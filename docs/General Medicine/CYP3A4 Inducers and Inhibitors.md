# Background
-   CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of more than 50% of medicines.
-   CYP3A4 activity is absent in new-borns but reaches adult levels at around one year of age.
-   Women have higher CYP3A4 activity than men.

Note:
- Strong, moderate, and weak inhibitors are drugs that increase the AUC of sensitive index substrates of a given metabolic pathway ≥5-fold, ≥2 to <5-fold, and ≥1.25 to <2-fold, respectively.
- Strong, moderate, and weak inducers are drugs that decreases the AUC of sensitive index substrates of a given metabolic pathway by ≥80%, ≥50% to <80%, and ≥20% to <50%, respectively.

## Inhibitors
Think of: azoles, ritonavir, FLQ, CNI, nonDHP-CCB, macrolides, H2RBs.

## Inducers
Think of: AEDs, rifampin, small molecule chemotherapies.
