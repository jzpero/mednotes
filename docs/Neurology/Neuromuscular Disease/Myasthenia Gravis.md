# Myasthenia Gravis
Autoimmune mediated destruction of the postsynaptic NMJ.

# Clinical Presentation
Fatiguable weakness in young women in their 20s and older men in their 60s:

| Group       | Presentation                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Ocular      | Ptosis, binocular diplopia, pupil-sparing         |
| Bulbar      | dysarthria, dysphagia, chewing fatigue, head drop |
| Respiratory | orthopnea                                         |
| Extremities | proximal > distal weakness, intense fatigue       |

# Myasthenic Crisis
## Elective [Intubation](../../Critical%20Care/Procedures/Intubation.md)
Consider for the 20-30-40 rule as described for [Guillain-Barré Syndrome](Guillain-Barré%20Syndrome.md). Essentially, if FVC < 20 mL/kg, absolute MIP less than 30 cm H2O, absolute MEP < 40 cm H2O, consider early [intubation](../../Critical%20Care/Procedures/Intubation.md).

## Immunosuppressive Agents
1. PLEX (preferred due to rapidity of action), vs
2. IVIg (2 g/kg over 2-5 days)

Hold pyridostigmine while [intubated](../../Critical%20Care/Procedures/Intubation.md) (for airway secretion management).
Consider high-dose prednisone (can cause transient worsening of respiratory status within the next 5-10d)

# Maintenance Treatment of MG
## Symptomatic Therapy
Pyridostigmine 60 mg PO TID - causes GI upset, bronchorrhea, cholinergic effects

## Disease Modifying Therapy
1. Prednisone - the lowest effective dose.
2. Azathioprine or MMF
3. Maintenance PLEX
4. Maintenance IVIg
5. Eculizumab - needs vaccination against encapsulated organisms

## Thymectomy
Refer to thoracic surgery for the 10% of patients with a thymoma.
If the patient does NOT have a thymoma, consider elective thymectomy if under age 60, AChRAb+, or if disease duration is less than 5 years (essentially, early and young).
