# CIDP

CIDP is the most common chronic autoimmune neuropathy with a prevalence of 2.8/100,000. Approximately 5% of [AIDP](Guillain-Barré%20Syndrome.md) progresses to a chronic state, also called CIDP.

Clinical features develop over 2 months at least
1. progressive symmetrical proximal and distal weakness
2. Large fibre sensory loss
3. areflexia
4. Fatigue

Generally, the cranial nerves, autonomic processes, and respiratory functions are left intact.

# Diagnostic Evaluation of CIDP
EMG/NCS
Neuropathy bloodwork: HbA1c, CBC, lytes, liver, renal, thyroid function. B12, MMA, SPEP, UPEP, IFE, FLC analysis.
LP for albuminocytologic dissociation
MRI spine with Gad to evaluate for nerve root enhancement

# Treatment of CIDP
As opposed to [AIDP](Guillain-Barré%20Syndrome.md), steroids are indicated in this context.
Treatment for CIDP consists of maintenance IVIg 1g/kg every 3 weeks or subcutaneous Ig, and prednisone 1 mg/kg.

# Prognosis of CIDP
25% complete remission
50% require ambulatory assist devices
10% are permanently disabled
