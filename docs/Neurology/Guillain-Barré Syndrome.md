# Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)
## Background
The most common and severe **acute paralytic neuropathy**. Incidence is 1:100,000. Increased risk with male sex and increased age. Follows a typical clinical pattern, usually preceded by infection or immune trigger. The diagnosis is largely clinical.

## Etiology
Onset is 1-2 weeks after immune stimulation.

- s/p **acute infectious process** (70%)
    - usually *respiratory or GI infection*
    - 20-30% of cases are due to *Campylobacter jejuni*
    - Other common inciting pathogens are a HHV infection such as EBV or CMV, HIV, hepatitis E, influenza A, arboviruses (Zika virus, Chikungunya), *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*
- s/p **vaccination**
    - H1N1 influenza vaccine
    - Semple Rabies vaccine
- **lupus**
- **lymphoma**

## Pathogenesis/Immunology
Essentially, this is an autoimmune process leading to **acute neuropathy** which can be either **(1) demyelinating** or **(2) axonal (motor or sensory)** in type. This process is likely antibody-mediated, driven by molecular mimicry between microbial and cellular surface antigens.

The axonal neuropathy subtypes are more associated with **anti-GM1** and **anti-GD1a** IgG autoantibodies.

## Clinical Features

- **rapidly (hours to days) ascending  paralysis**
    - may be noticed as "rubbery legs" at first
    - frequently accompanied with tingling dysesthesias in the extremities
    - legs > arms
    - facial diparesis in 50%
    - lower cranial nerve involvement with bulbar weakness and difficulty handling secretions
    - areflexia
    - ventilatory support (30%) required
- cutaneous sensorium mostly preserved as these are small fibers that are not affected as much
- **autonomic involvement**
    - transient bladder dysfunction
    - loss of vasomotor control
        - blood pressure changes
        - postural hypotension
        - cardiac dysrhythmia
- **pain**
    - acute neck, back, spine pain (50%)
    - deep, aching muscular-type pain
    - dysesthetic pain in the extremities due to sensory fibre involvement

In terms of the **timeframe**, most patients plateau in symptoms within 4-6 weeks and progression beyond that point is unlikely. All patients improve but some may have residual symptoms.

### Miller-Fischer Syndrome
Defined by presence of **anti-GQ1b antibodies (90%)**. Often affects cranial nerves. This is a triad of:

1. Ophthalmoplegia
2. Ataxia
3. Areflexia

## Investigations

- **CSF** typically shows elevated protein within 1 week, without a sustained pleocytosis

## Treatment of GBS

- **IVIG or plasmapheresis** are proven to help improve symptoms and prognosis in acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Probably not helpful once patients reach the plateau phase. Combination is not proven to be better than one alone. For this reason, IVIG is usually the first line treatment due to safety and ease. 
    - IVIG 0.4 g/kg x 5 days
    - These interventions decrease need for ventilation by half. Improvements may be delayed.
    - steroids are not shown to be helpful
- General medical supportive care
    - Critical care, stepup, neurology ward setting as appropriate
    - Respiratory status and ventilation if needed +/- trach
    - Cardiac and hemodynamic management (autonomic instability common)
    - Pain control
    - PT/OT/rehab
    - GI/GU
    - DVT ppx

## Prognosis

- Mortality is 3-7%
-   Death generally occurs from ventilatory failure, pulmonary complications, or from autonomic dysfunction --> arrhythmia
-   About 20% of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome cannot walk unaided 6 months after onset
-   Most patients have residual pain and fatigue, which can in part be attributed to persistent axonal loss.
