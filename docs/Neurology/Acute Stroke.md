# Acute Stroke
## Immediate Treatment of Stroke
### Reperfusion (Time=Brain)
#### tPA

- Window for any tPA is 4.5 hours from known onset of symptoms. Overall it increases [ICH](../Critical%20Care/Neuro%20Critical%20Care/Intracranial%20Hemorrhage.md) but the overall benefit prevails in this time period.
- Indications for tPA are simple: (1) ischemic stroke causing a measurable neurological deficit, (2) time between 0 and 4.5 hours before beginning treatment, (3) adult
- Contraindications are more complex:

#### Endovascular thrombectomy

### Adjunct Treatment

## Secondary Prevention of Stroke
### Address Comorbidities

- hypertension
- [dyslipidemia.md](dyslipidemia.md)
- [diabetes mellitus.md](diabetes%20mellitus.md)
- smoking
- extracranial carotid artery stenosis
- intracranial carotid artery stenosis
- [atrial fibrillation](atrial%20fibrillation)
- patent foramen ovale closure

###  High-Risk Transient Ischemic Attack or Minor Stroke

In these patients (TIA with ABCD >= 4, minor stroke with NIHSS less than or equal to 3), dual anti-platelet therapy is warranted as per several recent trials (CHANCE[^1], POINT[^2] for clopidogrel and THALES[^3] for ticagrelor).

!!! example "Clopidogrel-based DAPT"
    1. Load with ASA 162 mg PO and clopidogrel 300 mg PO
    2. ASA 81 mg PO and clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily for 21 days
    3. Antiplatelet monotherapy afterwards indefinitely
    
!!! example "Ticagrelor-Based DAPT"
    1. test
    2. test
    3. test

Antiplatelet monotherapy as maintenance can be one of three accepted regimens:

1. ASA 81 mg once daily
2. Clopidogrel 75 mg once daily
    3. CAPRIE trial
3. ASA + dipyridamole
    4. ESPS II, ESPRIT, and PRoFESS trials
