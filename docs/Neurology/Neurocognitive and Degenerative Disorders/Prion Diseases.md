Prion diseases are a group of closely related neurodegenerative conditions in mammals, in which a prior protein (PrP) forms abnormal conformations and aggregates. These are para-infectious agents which can be transmitted between hosts.

# Epidemiology
- Rare: 1-2 cases per million annually.
- Acquired (1) **sporadically** (90%), (2) **genetically**, or (3) **infectiously** (very rare, less than 1% of cases)
- Presents in late-middle or late life, with a peak incidence in the 8th decade of life. Can be younger (teens), and genetic forms tend to present the most in the 60's.
- Two human outbreaks of prion disease
	- **Kuru** - epidemic in tribes in New Guinea, due to ritualistic cannibalism
	- **Variant CJD** - due to eating meat from infected cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, "Mad Cow Disease". Arose in Great Britain in 1994. Incredibly rare - only 228 documented cases.
- Scrapie in sheep, and chronic wasting disease in elk are endemic but not known to pass to humans
- Iatrogenic spread:
	- Blood and blood products from donors with variant CJD
	- Sporadic CJD has not been transmitted through blood products
	- Possible through contaminated surgical instruments, corneal transplants
- Genetic causes are due to specific mutations in the **PRNP gene**

# Pathobiology
PrP is a cell surface glycoprotein normally produced in the brain and other tissues. In prion diseases, an abnormally folded PrP named PRP(Sc) accumulates and recruits the normal PrP into more PrP(Sc) which forms beta-sheet aggregates in the brain.

The mechanism by which PrP aggregates cause neuronal dysfunction and death is unknown.

Enterally spread PrP: prions replicate in the enteric lymphatics, then spread to the CNS via sympathetic nerves in the lymphatic tissue. Once in the CNS, prions spread trans-synaptically.

# Clinical Manifestations
1. **Sporadic CJD** (the most common prion disease in humans)
	1. Prodrome of psychiatric disturbances is present in 25% of patients: anxiety, depression, altered sleep
	2. Cognitive dysfunction
	3. Motor signs (ataxia, bradykinesia, spasticity), *myoclonus* is characteristic
	4. Vague somatic sensory disturbances
	5. *The decrements of neurologic degeneration occurs over the span of weeks.*
	6. Variants in the typical presentation occur:
		1. **Gertmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome**: prominent ataxia with slower decline.
		2. **Fatal familial insomnia**: anxiety and depression and sleep disturbance followed by ataxia and motor signs
2. **Variant CJD**: much younger mean age at onset (26 years age) with more prominent psychiatric and sensory signs early in the disease, followed by a later emergence of dementia and motor signs.
3. **Iatrogenic CJD:** resembles sporadic CJD, can overlap with the presentation of Gertmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome.
4. **Variable protease encephalopathy:** presents similarly to frontal lobe dementia

# Diagnosis of Prion Disease
Consider prion disease for **any patient with rapidly worsening cognitive impairment** or  [Dementia](Dementia.md). This generally will involve [CSF Analysis](../CSF%20Analysis.md) (via LP) and neuroimaging (MR, EEG).

The RT-QuIC PrP amplification assay works by assuming the presence of PrP(Sc) acts as a "seed" and propagates in the presence of catalysts and PrP. This reaction is detected and quantified, and has an exceptionally high specificity and sensitivity.

# Treatment
These diseases are universally incurable. No treatment improves the course of disease. The majority of patients with sporadic CJD die within a year of diagnosis after progressing to a state of **akinetic mutism**.
