# Delirium
## Definition

Clinical dx of **acute, fluctuating LOC/confusion/cognitive changes**.
Classically consists of **attention deficit** with other symptoms such as altered sleep-wake cycles, hallucinations, delusions, changes in affect, and autonomic symptoms.

Can be **hyperactive** or **hypoactive** or **mixed**.

Delirium is a **CNS manifestation of usually a non-CNS problem. It is a medical emergency unless proven otherwise.**

## Risk Factors
Major RF are age (65+), baseline cognitive dysfunction or dementia (MMSE > 24), sensory deprivation, poor overall health, infection and acute illness (APACHE II > 16), surgery, pain, poor vision (<20/70), dehydration.

Major precipitating factors are physical restraint, Foley catheter, malnutrition, new medications, iatrogenic events.

## Outcomes
Increases LOS, infections, functional decline, institutionalization, recidivism.

High mortality risk, about 25-33% in-hospital.

Associated with persistent cognitive dysfunction.

## Pathogenesis
Occurs from widespread disturbances in cortical and subcortical brain regions with diffuse cerebral dysfunction. This is a result of an **insult to a predisposed individual**.

Theories range from cholinergic failure hypotheses, to dopamine excess, to HPA axis stress response, to cytokines in inflammation.

## Etiology
| Category        | Example                                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **D**rugs       | Rx drugs, overdose/abuse, poisoning/toxidrome                                           |
| **I**nfection   | Pneumonia, UTI, skin, CNS, etc.                                                         |
| **M**etabolic   | electrolytes, glucose, temperature, oxygenation, liver and renal, thyroid, vitamins/thiamine/B12, hydration, nutrition |
| **E**nvironment | hospitalization, poor vision, etc.                                                      |
| **S**tructural  | CNS lesions, strokes, blood pressure, etc.                                                                                        |

Pay particular attention to:

- anticholinergics, antihistamines, opioids, benzodiazepines
- serotonin syndrome/neuroleptic malignant syndrome
- urinary retention
- drugs of abuse
- lytes and glucose
- calcium
- liver and renal failure
- dehydration
- ANY infection
- thyroid
- end of life
- seizures

## Assessment

The **Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)** is a 4-question screen for delirium. It requires (1) and (2). It is 82% sens and 99% spec for delirium. It is the best bedside instrument for dx of delirium.

-   (1) acute onset and fluctuating course;
-   (2) inattention with either (3) or (4);
-   (3) disorganized thinking;
-   (4) altered LOC.

Form and investigate the differential based on **DIMS**. Decide on level of care needed (may need to escalate with hemodynamic instability, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, methemoglobinemia, new focal neurologic signs, severely altered LOC).

Neuro examination would consist of the minimum:

1. Level of consciousness
2. speech and language
3. attention
4. orientation
5. cranial nerves
6. gross muscle strength
7. respiratory pattern and withdrawal to noxious stimuli, if unconscious

###  Tests of Attention
 
 - serial 7s
 - digit span, forwards (5) or backwards (3)
 - counting backwards
 - months/days in reverse
 - WORLD backwards
 - hypervigilance tests

### Other Common Features

- perceptual disturbances
- altered sleep-wake cycle
- emotional lability

### Head CT
Really only indicated with:

-  focal neuro finding which is persistent despite reversal of immediate physiologic derangement;
-  recent head trauma
-  decreased LOC with no other obvious cause
      

## Treatment

1. **Rule out alternatives** such as depression, dementia.
2.  **Treat reversible causes**
3.  **Supportive measures**
    1.  sitter, family
    3.  sensory optimization
    4.  mobility (i.e. remove physical restraints if possible)
    5.  hydration
    6.  self-care
    7.  **address fall risk**
4.  **Antipsychotics** are indicated if they're a physical threat to themselves or other, interfering with necessary medical treatment to resolve the underlying cause, or with extreme patient emotional distress. It doesn't improve outcomes but can convert hyperactive to hypoactive delirium. Start LOW and go SLOW. Benefit must outweigh the significant risks (below).
    1.  Haloperidol 0.25-0.5 mg PO/IV/SC/IM BID -- try to avoid IV due to arrhythmia risk
    2.  Risperidone 0.25-0.5 mg PO BID
    3.  Olanzapine 2.5-5.0 mg PO daily
    4.  Quetiapine 6.25-25 mg PO BID/TID
5.  **Benzos** have a limited role; they are reserved for sedative drug/ETOH withdrawal, catatonia and when antipsychotics are contraindicated such as severe QT prolongation. They can worsen confusion and sedation. Less effective overall. Dangerous in elderly.
 
 
With antipsychotics, keep in mind the risks of **EPS/Parkinsonism**, stroke, dysrhythmias like **QT prolongation/[TdP](../Cardiology/Temporary%20Cardiac%20Pacing.md)**/SCD, pneumonia, falls, incontinence, NMS.
