# Classification and Etiologies
Nephrotic syndrome can be primary (histopathologic diagnosis) or secondary (presents with the histopathology but with an underlying driving cause).

## FSGS
- hyperfiltration syndromes
	- obesity
	- decreased nephron mass
		- congenital renal malformations
		- solitary kidney
- HIV associated nephropathy
- APOL1 (2 hit hypothesis)
- Genetic causes --> circulating factors

## Membranous Nephropathy (MN)
Can be diagnosed in the right setting with anti-PLA2R (and disease activity can be trended).
- Infection (hepatitis/HIV)
- Drugs (NSAIDs, gold, penicillamine)
- Cancer (solid organ)
- Autoimmune (SLE, CTD)

## Minimal Change Disease (MCD)
Typically seen most in children (>90% of cases), where it has a good initial treatment response to steroids but trends to be a relapsing disorder.
- Lymphoma
- NSAIDs

## MPGN

## Diabetic Nephropathy

## Amyloid/Hematologic
