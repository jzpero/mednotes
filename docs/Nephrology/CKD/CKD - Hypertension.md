# Blood Pressure Targets
| Population           | BP Target          | Preferred Agents |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| [SPRINT](Hypertension#SPRINT)               | SBP < 120 mm Hg    |                  |
| Transplant recipient | < 130/80 mm Hg     | ARB, DHP-CCB     | 
| [ADPKD](../Polycystic%20Kidney%20Disease%20(PKD).md)                | SBP < 95-110 mm Hg |                  |
| All others           | SBP < 140 mm Hg    |                  |

# Lifestyle Interventions
1.  Sodium target < 2 g/day (<90 mM/day, or <5 g NaCl/day) for those with high blood pressure and CKD.
	1.  Not appropriate for those with sodium-wasting nephropathy.
	2.  [DASH](Hypertension#DASH%201997) or salt-substitutes may not be appropriate for those with advanced CKD or other causes of impaired K excretion.
2. Physical activity target > 150 minutes moderately intense activity/week, or as tolerated. Modify to the individual's capacity.

# Pharmacotherapy
1. Diuretics
	1. Loop
	2. Thiazide
2. ACE inhibitors
3. SGLT2 inhibitors
4. Calcium channel blockers


## Diuretics
### Loop Diuretics
The mainstay of treatment of HTN in CKD with urine production.

### Thiazide Diuretics
**CLICK trial (NEJM 2021)** showed that a chlorthalidone-based antihypertensive strategy was:
1. effective (-11 mmHg) and relatively safe in patients with stage 4 CKD (mean eGFR 23) and poorly controlled [hypertension](../../Cardiology/Hypertension.md) (mean 140 mmHg), over 12 weeks
2. It also decreased UACR increase by 50% compared to placebo, over 12 weeks.
