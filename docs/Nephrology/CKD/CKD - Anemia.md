# Background
-   The prevalence of anemia increases as the GFR decreases

# Workup
-   Usually due to CKD
-   Exclude and assess other causes as well:
	-   CBC
	-   RBC indices
	-   Reticulocytes
	-   Iron studies
	-   Folate
	-   Vitamin B12
	-   Stool occult blood

# Indications for Treatment
-   In general, treatment is needed when the Hgb < 100
-   Anemia is defined as less than 130 in men, and less than 120 in women

# Treatment
## Iron
-   Treat with iron if they are iron deficient, before the administration of ESAs
-   i.e. **TSAT <25% and ferritin <200 ng/mL**
-   Usually is IV iron

## ESAs
- Treat if the Hgb is less than 100, provided that iron is repleted**
-   Route: subcutaneous preferred
	-   30% lower dose with subcut than IV administration
	-   More convenient, allows for self-administration
-   Dose: darbepoetin
	-   60 to 200 mcg subcut every 2 to 4 weeks
	-   Use the lowest effective dose
	-   Increased risk of mortality and CV events with higher ESA doses regardless of Hgb
-   Target Hgb level for most people is **100 to 115**
	-   Individualize, there is no rigorous target
	-   Targeting higher than 130 is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes
-   Adverse events are common
	-   Increased risk of CV events
	-   [Hypertension](../../Cardiology/Hypertension.md) (independent of the Hgb)
	-   HD access thrombosis (Hgb level related)
	-   Higher rates of adverse events in history of stroke or malignancy
-   Benefits consist of
	-   Reduced need for transfusion
	-   Improved QOL
	-   Improved exercise tolerance and LVH
