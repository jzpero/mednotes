| Trial      | Very Early | Early | Delayed/Standard | More-Delayed |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| ELAIN      | x          | x     |                  |              |
| AKIKI      |            |       |                  |              |
| IDEAL-ICU  |            |       |                  |              |
| STARRT-AKI |            | x     | **x**                |              |
| AKIKI 2    |            |       | **x**                | x            |

In summary:
- early KRT may lead to more KRT dependence in the long term, and does not improve mortality
- more-delayed KRT may increase mortality but does not decrease KRT dependence
- **Therefore, consider a delayed/standard approach for most patients:**. Indications to proceed to dialyze in these circumstances are:
	- Stage II or III AKI + acidemia (pH < 7.20)/acidosis (bicarb < 12)/pulmonary edema (PF < 200)/72 hours of AKI (per STARRT-AKI)
	- Stage III AKI + oliguria/anuria or azotemia (Urea >40 mM) per AKIKI 2
- **Consider a more-delayed approach for selected patients**
	- Stage III AKI + preserved UOP + urea <40 mM (per AKIKI 2)
- **Dialyze emergently for urgent indications** (severe metabolic acidosis, severe acidemia, severe volume overload) regardless of other patient characteristics

# ELAIN (2016)
Question: In critically unwell patients with acute kidney injury, does *early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) compared to delayed initiation* reduce all cause mortality at 90 days?

Single centre RCT in mostly surgical patients: lower mortality among patients that received KRT within 8 hours of developing AKI stage 2 + NGAL > 150 ng/ml vs patients that received KRT after 12 hours of developing AKI stage 3 or an absolute indication of KRT.

# AKIKI (2016)
Question: In critically ill patients with acute kidney injury does *delayed compared with early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT)* reduce mortality at 60 days?

# IDEAL-ICU (2018)

multicenter randomized trial showed no difference in mortality between septic patients that received KRT at 12 hours of developing AKI RIFLE stage F vs patients that received KRT after 48 hours of developing AKI RIFLE stage F.

# STARRT-AKI (2020)
*Early vs standard initiation of KRT*. Multicentre multinational study of N=3000 patients.

## Population
- Adults in the ICU with renal dysfunction and severe AKI (double Cr from baseline, or oliguria).
- Exclusion: emergency KRT indications, advanced baseline CKD, previous KRT

## Arms
1. **Accelerated strategy**: KRT started within 12 hours
2. **Standard strategy:** KRT not started until one or more of hyperkalemia (K>6), acidemia (pH <7.20), metabolic acidosis (HCO3 <= 12), PF ratio < 200 and volume overloaded, or persistent AKI for 72 hours after randomization

## Outcomes
1. Death from any cause at 90 days
2. Secondary outcomes: MAKE, pressors, VFDs, hospital LOS, etc.

## Results
1. No significant difference in mortality at 90 days (44% vs 44%)
2. Increased RRT dependence at D90 with accelerated strategy (10.4% vs 6%, RR 1.74)
3. No sigificant difference in MAKE, eGFR D90, mortality in ICU or hospital, RRT free at D90, VFD at D90, pressor dependence at D90.

> [!NOTE] STARRT-AKI SUMMARY
> In critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury, an accelerated strategy for the initiation of renal-replacement therapy did not result in a lower mortality at 90 days than a standard strategy, and led to an increased risk of RRT dependence at 90 days.

# AKIKI 2 (2021)
*Delayed vs more-delayed strategy.*

## Population
 - adults in ICU on pressors or mechanical ventilation
 - KDIGO Stage III AKI with oliguria/anuria or azotemia (Urea 40-50 mM)
 - Excludes patients with urgent indications for RRT (hyperkalemia, acidosis, pulmonary edema despite diuresis, urea > 50 mM, baseline severe CKD

## Arms
1. Delayed strategy (KRT to be initiated within 12 hours of fulfilling randomisation criteria)
2. More-delayed strategy (KRT postponed until an urgent indication occurred [see below] or urea > 50 mM for 1 day). Duration of anuria is not a criterion.

## Outcomes
1. Primary outcome: KRT-free days up to day 28
2. Secondary outcomes included vital status up to 2 months, renal recovery at 60 days, CLABSIs

## Results
1. Primary outcome: No significant difference between delayed strategy and more-delayed strategy (12 vs 10 days)
2. More-delayed strategy is associated with higher 60-day mortality in multivariate analysis (HR 1.65, p=0.018).
3. No difference in KRT dependence at day 60, AKI/RRT complciations, fluid balances, and other secondary outcomes


> [!NOTE] AKIKI 2 SUMMARY
> In patients with severe Stage III AKI with oliguria or azotemia (urea 40-50 mM), a more-delayed strategy (refractory hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, or refractory pulmonary edema) did not improve RRT-free days, and possibly leads to increased mortality.
