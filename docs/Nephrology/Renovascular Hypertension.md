# Fibromuscular Dysplasia-Related Renal Artery Stenosis
- workup for FMD if HTN and one of more:
	- Asymmetrical kidneys (>1.5 cm difference)
	- Abdominal bruit without other athersclerosis
	- History of FMD in other vascular bed
	- Family histrory of FMD
- Workup:
	- CTA or MRA
- If FMD confirmed:
	- **screen vasculature from head to pelvis** with CTA or MRA:
		- cervicocephalic lesions, intracranial aneurysms, etc.

## Management of FMD-RAS
- Refer for angioplasty (typically not stented due to risk of periprocedural dissection).

# Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis
-   90% of RAS is due to ARAS (atherosclerotic RAS

## Who to Screen?
Patients presenting with 2 or more of the following (HTN 2020 Guidelines):
1) Sudden onset or worsening hypertension age > 55 or < 30
2) Abdominal bruit
3) Resistant hypertension
4) Increase in Cr > 30% with RAASi
5) Other atherosclerotic disease
6) Recurrent flash pulmonary edema

How to screen? Any of:
1) Renal Doppler US
2) Captopril renogram (avoid if GFR < 60)
3) MRA
4) CTA (avoid if GFR < 60)

## Landmark Studies Comparing Angioplasty to Medical Management 
| Study                  | Year | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EMMA                   | 1998 | No difference in BP with angioplasty at 6 months                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Scottish and Newcastle | 1998 | Lower BP in bilateral RAS with angioplasty. No difference in CV events or death                                                                                                                                               |
| STAR                   | 2009 | No difference in renal function at 24 months with angioplasty/stent with >50% stenosis                                                                                                                                        |
| ASTRAL                 | 2009 | After a mean follow up of 34 months, there was no significant difference in kidney outcomes, blood pressure control, or cardiovascular events (p=0.06). However, low risk RAS with 40% of them having less than 70% stenosis. |
| CORAL                  | 2014 | No difference in composite CV/renal outcome at 43 months. Higher risk patients than ASTRAL. Possibly lower SBP with stenting.                                                                                                 |

## Current Management of ARAS
1. **Optimal medical management** is first-line therapy (IA recommendation)
	-   RAAS inhibition (*not* contraindicated, but need to monitor K/Cr)
	-   High intensity statin
	-   Smoking cessation
	-   HbA1c control
	-   Antiplatelet agent

2. **Refer for revascularization when medical management has failed** (IIb recommendation, 2017 [Hypertension](../Cardiology/Hypertension.md) Guidelines)
	- Conditions:
		- Refractory hypertension despite maximal medical therapy
		- Progressively worsening renal function
		- Acute pulmonary edema
	- Action:
		- Refer the patient for consideration of revascularization (percutaneous renal artery angioplasty and/or stent placement).
