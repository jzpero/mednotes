## Epidemiology
Solitary fibrous tumours (SFTs) are exceedingly rare types of sarcomas (3.7% of soft-tissue sarcomas). These tumours can arise in the serous membranes, the meningeal dura, and the deep soft tissues.

## Distribution of Disease
30% pleural, 30% abdominal, 20% head and neck including the meninges, and 20% in other sites (bones, deep soft truncal or limb tissues).

## Pathophysiology
Characteristic genetic defect: 12q13 inversion resulting in fusion of NAB2 and STAT6

## Clinical Presentation
Patients typically present with a palpable mass. These can be of variable growth, from indolent to highly aggressive and frankly malignant.

Less than 5% of patients can present with refractory paraneoplastic [Hypoglycemia](../Endocrinology/Hypoglycemia.md), called **Doege-Potter syndrome**, which was originally described in 1930 in the Annals of Surgery.

## Management of SFT
1. Surgical resection with wide negative margins
2. Radiation therapy, either neoadjuvant or adjuvant or palliative
3. Systemic chemotherapy in the setting of incurable metastatic SFT
