# Epidemiology
RCC is the 7th leading cancer in men and 12th leading cancer in women. About 2% are associated with inherited conditions and the other 98% are spontaneous.

# Pathophysiology
RCC arises from the renal epithelium and accounts for 85% of renal cancers.

## Risk Factors
- Smoking
- Obesity
- Hypertension
- Acquired cystic kidney disease with ESRD
- Male sex
- Age 60-70s

# Diagnosis
## Clinical Manifestations
- classic triad of flank pain, hematuria, and a palpable abdominal mass
- often asymptomatic and radiographically detected incidentally
	- CT KUB in all people < 40 with any hematuria + Cystoscopy in people > 40 to rule out bladder cancer

## Imaging
- enhancing renal mass on a CT scan obtained after the administration of contrast material is a strong clue that renal cancer is present
- staging workup
- hereditary predisposition suggested by multiple lesions, family history of RCC

## Screening and Followup
- consider the VHL disease, hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer, and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndromes
	- uterine tumours
	- renal cysts, pancreatic, adrenal lesions (VHL)
- VHL disease --> MR of the brain and spinal cord to screen for hemangioblastoma
- immediately excise tumours from hereditary leiomyomatosis and RCC syndrome (aggressve)
- otherwise follow tumours from hereditary RCC using serial imaging until >3cm at which time they should be removed
- family pedigree should be generated

# Classification
The **Heidelberg classification** correlates  histopathological features with genetic defects.

## Clear-Cell RCC
- VHL disease (retinal angiomas, hemangioblastomas of the CNS, pheochromocytomas, and RCC) is classically associated with RCC
- Spontaneous mutations in VHL are responsible for 60% of spontaneous clear-cell RCC.

## Papillary RCC
- sporadic papillary RCC has a 5-year survival rate 90% and 5:1 male predominance
- Localized papillary RCC metastasizes less frequently than clear-cell RCC. However, the survival rate for metastatic papillary RCC is probably worse than that for clear-cell RCC
- the *MET* proto-oncogene is implicated in 75% of sporadic cases

# Prognosis
1/4 present with advanced disease (locally invasive or metastatic), and recurrence rates are high post resection of localized disease. 
Median survival for patients with metastatic disease is ~13 months.

# Treatment
## Surgical Approaches
- radical nephrectomy +/- surgical excision of solitary met
- nephron-sparing partial nephrectomy
- percutaneous ablative procedures (RF heat ablation or cryoablation)

## Medical Treatment
- offered for locally advanced or metastatic RCC
