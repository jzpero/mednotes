alias: CAR-T, ICANS, cytokine release syndrome

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (CAR-T) describes the use of genetically engineered T cells to attack cancer cells, and to improve the outcomes of patients with refractory/relapsed B-cell malignancies. Extended indications are being investigated (multiple [myeloma](../Malignant%20Hematology/Myeloma.md), etc.)

# Background of CAR-T
CAR-T products generally attack CD19 which is expressed by most B-cell malignancies. CAR-T can induce temporary or durable complete remission in the majority of patients.

CAR-T cells are "living drugs" individualised for each unique cancer patient. Prior to entering CAR-T cell therapy, patients are often bridged with cytotoxic drugs, B-cell antibodies (e.g. RTX), or radiotherapy.  Prior to receiving CAR-T, patients receive lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy to ensure tolerate and persistence of the CAR-T product.

After CAR-T, patients can develop significant acute toxicities, namely [Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)](CAR-T%20Recipients%20in%20the%20ICU.md#Cytokine%20Release%20Syndrome%20(CRS)) and [Immune effector Cellâ€“Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS)](CAR-T%20Recipients%20in%20the%20ICU.md#Immune%20effector%20Cellâ€“Associated%20Neurotoxicity%20Syndrome%20(ICANS)). These can range in severity from minor transient symptoms to severe life-threatening conditions.

CAR-T adverse toxicities correlate with high disease burden, higher peak of CAR-T cell expansion in the peripheral blood, and a high baseline inflammatory activity. More common in ALL than DLBCL

# Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)
CRS is a systemic inflammatory syndrome caused by immunotherapy, characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction.

CRS is the most common acute toxicity following CAR-T cell therapy (incidence is 37-93%). Generally occurs within hours to 1 week post CAR-T cell infusion; late occurence up to 14 days has been described. About 1/2 of patients require some form of immunomodulatory therapy.

CRS is caused by excess immune reaction stimulated in the setting of infections, immunomodulating drugs, etc. Associated with increased IL-6 levels.

## Diagnosis and Grading of CRS
1. Fever (T >38â„ƒ) is required for the diagnosis of CRS.
2. Nonspecific symptoms: malaise, myalgia, fatigue, GI symptoms, tachycardia, rash.
3. Cardiac: arrhythmias, vasodilatory shock, systolic HF or new onset cardiomyopathy
4. Respiratory: hypoxia
5. AKI
6. Labs:
	1. Hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia
	2. Concurrent tumour lysis syndrome
	3. Elevated CRP
7. Can range from self-limiting symptoms improved with symptomatic care, all the way to severe SIRS and MODS with high rates of mortality.

**CRS can co-exist with ICANS.**
After treatment with steroids and tocilizumab, fever may abate and is then not required for the diagnosis of CRS.

## Management of CRS
1. Consider empiric antimicrobial coverage, as differential frequently includes sepsis or septic shock.
2. Avoid the use of G-CSF as this can exacerbate CRS.
3. Consider the presence of ICANS as well, and treat as necessary. However, tocilizumab can worsen ICANS. Should lean more heavily on steroids if so.

### Refractory CRS
- Consider anakinra or ruxolitinib. 
- Consider the diagnosis of HLH - the patient can have an overlap syndrome of treatment-refractory CRS and HLH.

# Immune effector Cellâ€“Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS)
ICANS is encephalopathy secondary to systemic inflammation. Often occurs in the context of CRS, but not always. Has parallels in pathophysiology to sepsis-induced encephalopathy, but full mechanisms of disease are not known at this time. Key features seem to be disruption of the BBB and cytokine induced cerebral edema.

ICANS is extremely common, occurring in perhaps ~75% of patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel or brexucabtagene autoleucel. Lower rates occur with other CAR-T constructs.

**Risk factors for ICANS:** Fludarabine use for pre-treatment lymphodepletion, anti-CD19 products, ALL> lymphoma >> multiple [myeloma](../Malignant%20Hematology/Myeloma.md), higher burden of malignancy, pre-existing neurologic conditions, severe or early onset CRS, elevated inflammatory markers, DIC.

**Timing of ICANS:** generally begins within the first week after CAR-T therapy. Median onset of illness is 4-6 days, but can extend out to months after CAR-T therapy. Often ICANS starts 2-4 post CRS.

**Duration of ICANS:** about 2-3 weeks, but the encephalopathy can last months.

## Diagnosis and Grading of ICANS
### Clinical Manifestations
- Language abnormalities
	- Dysgraphia or expressive dysphagia
	- Evolution into global aphasia is highly suggestive of ICANS
- Tremor, fine motor impairment, asterixis, myoclonus.
- Altered level of consciousness.
- Fluctuating over time.
- Focal or generalized weakness
- Autonomic instability.
- Headache, meningeal irritation
- Seizures and status epilepticus.
- Clinical manifestations of cerebral edema and [Elevated ICP](../Critical%20Care/Neuro%20Critical%20Care/Elevated%20ICP.md)

### Radiology and Neurologic Investigations
1. **Neuroimaging is recommended for Grade 2 and above.** MRI +/- contrast is the preferred modality. However, most patients with ICANS have normal neuroimaging. Potential findings on neuroimaging:
	1. Symmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities involving the thalami and dorsal pons and tectal plate.
	2. Patchy reversible T2 hyperintensities in the WM
	3. Diffuse cerebral edema.
	4. Leptomeningeal enhancement.
	5. PRES-like findings.
	6. Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.
	7. Nonaneurysmal convexity [Subarachnoid Hemorrhage](../Neurology/Cerebrovascular%20Disease/Subarachnoid%20Hemorrhage.md)
2. CSF analysis to exclude CNS infection - consider in higher grade ICANS.
	1. elevated OP suggests Grade 4 ICANS
	2. Cytologic ?malignancy or hemophagocytosis
	3. JC virus PCR r/o PML
3. EEG to assess for seizures and the severity of encephalopathy.

### Grading of ICANS
Calculate the ICE score (a measure of encephalopathy in ICANS):

## Management of ICANS
1. Supportive measures
	1. Aggressive fever control.
	2. Discontinue medications that are sedating or lower the seizure threshold.
	3. Consider high-dose thiamine supplementation.
2. Management of [Elevated ICP](../Critical%20Care/Neuro%20Critical%20Care/Elevated%20ICP.md) which can include [ICP Monitoring](../Critical%20Care/Neuro%20Critical%20Care/ICP%20Monitoring.md)

### Steroids
Steroids are the mainstay of treatment of ICANS. Dexamethasone has greater CNS penetration thus is preferred over other steroids.

- **Grade 1**:
    - Isolated ICANS: Steroid generally isn't indicated. However, for lisocabtagene maraleucel or idecabtagene vicleucel, if ICANS develops <72 hours after infusion then consider dexamethasone 10 mg every 12-24 hours x2 doses and reassess.
    - ICANS plus CRS: Consider adding steroid for patients who are receiving tocilizumab (as discussed above, _isolated tocilizumab may worsen ICANS_). [ðŸ“–](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/cart/#cytokine_release_syndrome_(CRS))
- **Grade 2**:
    - One dose of IV dexamethasone 10 mg and reassess.
    - Can repeat every 6-12 hours, if no improvement.
- **Grade 3**:
    - All patients should receive dexamethasone 10 mg q6hr, until there is improvement.
- **Grade 4**:
    - High-dose methylprednisolone (e.g., 1,000 mg daily for three days, then 250 mg q12hr for 2 days, then 125 mg q12hr for 2 days, then 60 mg q12 hours for 2 days).

### Steroid-Refractory ICANS
Steroids generally lead to rapid improvement. Consider anakinra or ruxolitinib.

### Seizure Prophylaxis
Consider seizure prophylaxis (LEV) for axicabtagene ciloleucel with any grade of neurological toxicity, brexucabtagene autoleucel with Grade 2 or higher neurologic toxicity, patients at increased risk for seizures based on imaging or clinical history.
