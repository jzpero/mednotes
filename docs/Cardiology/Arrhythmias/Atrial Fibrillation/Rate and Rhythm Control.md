# Rate/Rhythm Control for Atrial Fibrillation
# Rate versus Rhythm Control 
1. AFFIRM (2002)
2. [EAST-AFNET 4](EAST-AFNET%204.md) demonstrated that early antiarrhythmic treatment may decrease long-term risk of MACE in recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation.

# Rate Control
1. RACE-II 
2. [RATE-AF](RATE-AF.md) demonstrated that in patients with symptomatic permanent AF, digoxin leads to better QOL than bisoprolol.

# Rhythm Control
1. **CASTLE-AF (2018)** showed that in patients with AF and symptomatic (NYHA II-IV) systolic heart failure (LVEF â‰¤ 35%), catheter ablation is associated with a 16.1% absolute reduction in death or hospitalization for heart failure when compared to medical therapy (rate or rhythm control).
