There are five phases of the cardiomyocyte action potential:

1.  Phase 0: rapid depolarization "upstroke"
2.  Phase 1: brief repolarization
3.  Phase 2: plateau phase
4.  Phase 3: rapid repolarization
5.  Phase 4: RMP @ -90 mV

## Phase 0: Rapid Depolarization

-   Feedback loop: Na+ channels begin to open in response to depolarization, which causes depolarizationâ€¦
-   Threshold potential: -70mV
	-   When the MP reaches this value, enough fast Na+ channels have opened to generate a self-sustaining inward Na+ current
-   These fast Na+ channels are only open for a few milliseconds, then are inactivated preventing further influx

## Phase 1: Brief Repolarization

-   Returns the MP to neutral (0 mV)
-   Caused by the outward flow of K+ ions through transiently activated K+ channels

## Phase 2: Plateau Phase

-   Long plateau phase is mediated by the balance of
	-   Outward K+ currents through VG delayed rectified K+ channels
	-   Inward Ca++ currents through L-type Ca++ channels
		-   Begin to open during phase 0 (rapid depolarization) at -40 mV
		-   Slower activation and channels remain open longer than Na channels
-   Nearly net zero current
-   Ca++ ions that enter are critical for the initiation of myocyte contraction
-   Phase ends as Ca++ channels are gradually inactivated and the charge efflux of K+ begins to exceed the charge influx of Ca++

## Phase 3: Rapid Repolarization

-   Continued outward K+ flow is primarily responsible
-   Positive ions that entered the cell (Na and Ca) must be actively pumped to retain the ion concentration gradients
