Cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) encompasses a spectrum of disorders involving both the heart and kidneys in which acute or chronic dysfunction in 1 organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ.

NHLBI definition: cardiorenal dysregulation leads to CRS, in which therapy to relieve congestive symptoms of HF is limited by further decline in renal function.

Difficult to determine commonly, which comes first, the heart issue or the kidney issue.
