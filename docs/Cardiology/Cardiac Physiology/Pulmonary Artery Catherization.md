# Pulmonary Artery Catherization


# PAWP/PAOP
PAOP readings are accurate only if the tip of the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is appropriately wedged in West lung zone 3, corresponding to the lower third of the lung where continuous blood flow can be assumed.

PAOP overestimates LVEDP in the following conditions:

• Chronic mitral stenosis
• PEEP
• Left atrial myxoma
• Pulmonary hypertension

PAOP underestimates LVEDP in the following conditions:

• Poorly compliant left ventricle
• LVEDP greater than 25 mm Hg
