# Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

# Management
1. Family screening and genetic counseling for all first degree relatives
2. Avoid volume depletion
3. **Beta-blockers are first line** (they do NOT reduce sudden cardiac death)
4. Consider procedural interventions (septal myomectomy, ETOH ablation)
5. consider ICD for:
	1. Sustained VT or prior cardiac arrest (Class I)
	2. FMHx of sudden death, thick LV wall > 30 mm, unexplained syncope (Class IIa)
