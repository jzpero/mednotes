# Definition
-   The original definition (2014) was myocardial injury due to myocardial ischemia, during or within 30 days after non-cardiac surgery
-   Currently, MINS is defined as
	-   (1) elevated post-operative troponin, due to myocardial ischemia
		-   Normal troponin T > 30 ng/L;
		-   hsTnT between 20 to 65 with absolute rise of at least 5;
		-   hsTnT >65
	-   (2) during or within 30 days of non-cardiac surgery
	-   (3) not requiring ischemic features (symptoms, ischemic EKG findings)
-   MINS includes
	-   MI (both symptomatic and non-symptomatic); and
	-   patients with postoperative elevations in troponin but who do not have symptoms, electrocardiographic abnormalities, or other criteria that meet the universal definition described above, and have no evidence of a nonischemic etiology for their troponin elevation

# Pathophysiology
-   MINS excludes a non-ischemic etiology:
	-   AFRVR
	-   Sepsis
	-   Pulmonary embolism
-   The majority (>85%) of postoperative hsTn elevations are due to myocardial ischemia
-   Ischemia is, at its core, due to coronary artery supply-demand mismatch and/or thrombosis
-   Etiology:
	-   Thrombosis (1/4 to 1/3) is relatively uncommon cause of MINS
	-   Supply-demand mismatch (Almost all patients have underlying coronary artery stenosis)

# Significance
-   MINS is independently associated with 30 day and 1-year mortality
-   Increases the risk for:
	-   Recurrent MI
	-   CHF
	-   Serious arrhythmia

# Management of MINS

## Medical Management
-   ASA and statin should be started; i.e. cardiovascular medication intensification for CAD
-   Beta blocker if hypertensive and tachycardic
-   ACE inhibitor if hypertensive with no tachycardia
-   The above are based on risk-adjusted observational data
-   Dabigatran
	-   Evidence: **MANAGE RCT** (Lancet, PJ Devereux)
	-   However, dabigatran was compared to placebo control and grouped arterial and venous thrombosis.

## Coronary Revascularization
-   Data shows there may be benefit; risks are high:
	-   Bleeding
	-   Low rate of revascularization with coronary angiography (37%)
-   Wise to only go for cath with MINS if there is recurrent cardiac instability (heart failure, ischemia)

## Troponins after surgery
-   Most MINS/MI happens within 48 hours after surgery, and often is asymptomatic
-   Asymptomatic cases have the same risks as symptomatic cases
-   The vast majority (82-93%) of MINS occurs without any ischemic symptoms, and need troponin screening
-   Recommendations:
	-   Screen patients who are at high risk for cardiac injury:
		-   Over 65 years of age
		-   History of atherosclerotic disease
	-   Measure troponins on days 1, 2, 3, after non-cardiac surgery while in hospital
