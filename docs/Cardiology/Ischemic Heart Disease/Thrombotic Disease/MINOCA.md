# Definitions
-   MINOCA = Myocardial Infarction with No Obstructive Coronary Atherosclerosis
-   A clinical syndrome defined by:
	-   Evidence of MI
	-   Normal or near normal coronary arteries on angiography (stenosis <= 50%)

# Epidemiology
-   MINOCA is the cause of AMI in about 6% of cases

# Prognosis
-   Uncertain due to the varied underlying conditions
-   Generally has a lower in-hospital and 12-month mortality than MI due to obstructive CAD

# Causes of MINOCA
## Epicardial Vessels
-   **Coronary artery vasospasm / variant angina / Prinzmetal angina**
	-   Can be localized univessel, or multifocal, or even multivessel
	-   Autonomic triggers
	-   Drugs: ephedrine, cocaine, MJ, ETOH, butane, sumatriptan, amphetamines
	-   PCI guide wire or balloon dilatation
	-   Botulism
	-   Mg deficiency
	-   Allergy (Kounis syndrome)
-   **Non-obstructive eccentric plaque, with acute thrombosis**
	-   May by missed on angiography due to eccentric growth and a thin cap
	-   Needs intravascular imaging: ICT, intravascular ultrasound

## Coronary Microvasculature
-   **Takotsubo CM**
	-   Apical ballooning of the LV in the absence of CAD
-   **Coronary microvascular dysfunction ("coronary syndrome X" or "angina pectoris with normal coronary arteries)**
	-   Transient myocardial ischemia with ST changes and angina;
	-   Spontaneous or induced by intracoronary ACh;
	-   Absence of obstructive CAD and epicardial spasm
-   **Viral myocarditis**
	-   Adenovirus, parvovirus B19, HHV6, Coxsackievirus
	-   HIV
-   **Coronary artery embolism**
	-   Often affects the microvasculature, but may be also associated with visible embolization of the epicardial coronary artery branches on angiography
	-   Suspect with MINOCA and once of:
		-   Prosthetic valve
		-   AF
		-   DCM with apical thrombus
		-   Rheumatic heart disease with MS
		-   IE
		-   Atrial myoxoma
		-   Paradoxical embolism

# Management
-   MINOCA has a similar risk of recurrent CV events over time, comparable to ACS and obstructive atherosclerosis
-   Requires **DAPT 12/12 + statins**
