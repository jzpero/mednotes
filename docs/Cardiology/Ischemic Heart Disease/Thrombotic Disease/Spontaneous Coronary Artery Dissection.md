# Background
*   SCAD is emerging an important cause of [MI](ACS.md) particularly in younger women
*   SCAD is a nonathersclerotic, nontraumatic cause of [ACS](ACS.md) and SCD
*   high level evidence based guidance is lacking

## Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, Genetics
*   **Typical patient:** middle aged woman, few traditional CV risk factors. However, occurs in late teens to 90s. Underlying factors include sex, hormonal fluctuations, arteriopathies, genetics, precipitants (environment, physical, emotional)
    *   Women (87-95%)
    *   Middle-aged (44-53 years mean age)
    *   White (but in all backgrounds as well)
    *   May be lacking hypertertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking as risk factors (same as general matched population proportion)
*   **Prevalence of 4% in all [ACS](ACS.md) and up to 35% of all [ACS](ACS.md) in women < 50 years of age**
*   **Pathophysiology**
    *   acute coronary artery event
    *   development of hematoma within tunica media -- separation of the intimal complex from the underlying vessel and compression of the true lumen causing ischemia and AMI
    *   two hypotheses
        *   (1) "inside-out" --Â  development of an intimal flap, and blood enters from the true lumen
        *   (2) "outside-in" \-\- hematoma arises de novo in the media from disruption of traversing microvessels. This is MORE LIKELY. Hematomas are PRESSURED and precede development of flap.\
*   **Genetics**
    *   associated with some SNPs - related to monogenic changes; +familial risk
    *   _FMD_ is associated with SCAD
*   **Sex hormones**
    *   Temporally, SCAD has been reported to occur just before or during menstruation while taking hormonal contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone therapy and in women with a history of infertility and/or prior or current treatment for infertility.
    *   unknown MOA
*   **Pregnancy-associated SCAD (P-SCAD)** occurs at any time during or after pregnancy  
    *   70% occur post-partum, usually within 1st week
    *   typically more severe/multivessel presentation
    *   comprises up to 1/6 of SCAD overall
    *   associated with older age at first childbirth, multigravidas

# Presentation and Diagnosis
*   **Triggers**
    *   pregnancy, as above
    *   extreme physical or emotional stress
*   **Clinical presentation**
    *   similar to atherosclerotic [ACS](ACS.md)  
        *   chest pain or equivalent symptoms
        *   elevated serial biomarkers and ECG findings c/w [NSTEMI](ACS.md)/[STEMI](STEMI)
        *   cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, SCD
    *   therefore, Dx often missed in this patient population
*   **Diagnosis**
    *   **Catheter-based coronary angiography**
        *   the primary and typically only necessary modality for diagnosis of SCAD
        *   predilection for mid-to-distal coronary arteries, most commonly LAD
        *   higher risk features
            *   multivessel involvement
            *   severe stenosis
            *   isolated intramural hematoma
    *   **Intravascular and noninvasive imaging**
        *   Not really used. Options are IVUS, OCT, CMR, [CCTA](../Diagnosis%20and%20Screening/Coronary%20CT%20Angiography.md)

# Acute Management of SCAD
Goals are (1) restore/preserve myocardial perfusion and function (2) avoid adverse outcomes related to thrombolysis.

## Revascularization

## Medical Therapy

*   There are no RCTs to guide SCAD-specific pharmacologic management. Treatment is based on sequelae and associated risks
    *   LV dysfunction --> [GDMT](../../Heart%20Failure/GDMT/Guideline-Directed%20Medical%20Therapy.md)
        *   beta blocker associated with less SCAD recurrence
    *   PCI with stent --> standard post-PCI DAPT therapy
    *   Hypertension --> antihypertensives
    *   Hyperlipidemia --> _primary prevention_ guidelines (no association with SCAD)
*   Discontinue systemic anticoagulation/GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors once the Dx of SCAD is made, unless there are other indications for systemic anticoagulation or there is an apparent intraluminal thrombus

Anti-thrombotic therapy for SCAD is not guided by strong evidence, but consider **DAPT for 2-4 weeks then low-dose ASA for 3-12 months total**. Decisions about further therapy should be individualized based on comorbidities and individual risk profile.
