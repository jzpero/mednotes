# Context
*   *   **Overtaking functional testing as first-line testing for stable [CAD](../Chronic%20Coronary%20Syndrome.md)** in some recent guidelines (e.g. [NICE 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12410-017-9412-6)), in part due to excellent test characteristics and highest cost efficacy for the correct diagnosis of [CAD](../Chronic%20Coronary%20Syndrome.md) for all non-invasive methods
    *   **Recent landmark trials (below) show noninferiority of CCTA compared to functional imaging,** and suggest decreased [MI](../Thrombotic%20Disease/ACS.md)/coronary death, better yield on coronary angiography, and better preventative therapy initation.
*   _New evidence is NOT reflected in most up-to-date CCS guidelines (2014)._

## Pros
* Very sensitive to detect coronary calcifications (associated with atherosclerosis) and can provide noninvasive angiography of the proximal coronary arteries.
	*   Therefore, negative CCTA is very favourable for prognosis.
	*   Identifies both obstructive and nonobstructive [CAD](../Chronic%20Coronary%20Syndrome.md) -- better overall prognostic information ([Link to PROMISE subgroup analysis showing this](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.024360))

## Cons
* No functional information -- no idea of reversibility of RWMA or exercise capacity, for example.

# Method
*  Requires rate limitation for clear pictures:
	*   Beta-blockers (e.g. metoprolol 50 mg afternoon before, night before, and then 1 hour before). Therefore cannot use with AVB, active reactive airway disease
	*   Cannot do with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation/flutter.
*   Requires breath-holding for clear pictures (?respiratory status @ baseline)

# Key Studies re: CCTA
1.  **PROMISE (NEJM 2015)** evaluated CCTA versus functional testing (exercise ECG, nuclear stress test, or stress echocardiography) in patients suspected to have symptomatic [CAD](../Chronic%20Coronary%20Syndrome.md), but no formal diagnosis of such yet. Overall finding was that there was no difference in MACE, but CCTA led to fewer catherizations showing no obstructive [CAD](../Chronic%20Coronary%20Syndrome.md) (3.4% vs 4.3%). Overall median radiation exposure per patient lower with CCTA, but overall exposure higher. Median 2 yr followup.

2.  **SCOT-HEART (NEJM 2018)** randomized 4146 patients with stable chest pain to CCTA + standard care, or standard care alone. Overall, CCTA decreased coronary death or nonfatal [MI](../Thrombotic%20Disease/ACS.md) at 5 years (2.3% vs 3.9%), and increased preventative therapies (19.4% vs 14.7%). Increased early coronary angiography. Lower delayed angiography. No significant differences in rates of long-term coronary angiography or coronary revascularization. Median followup 5 years.

    1.  _Likely driven by earlier + targeted revascularization if needed_
    2.  _Not driven by long-term increased revascularization._
    3.  _Likely also driven by earlier initiation of preventative management (ASA/statin), and higher sensitivity to nonobstructive [CAD](../Chronic%20Coronary%20Syndrome.md)._
3.  **JÃ¸rgensen et al (JACC 2017)** evaluated retrospectively 87,000 stable patients undergoing initial noninvasive cardiac testing with CCTA or functional testing (exercise ECG, nuclear stress test). Overall finding was that CCTA was greater use of statins, aspirin, and invasive procedures, and higher costs than functional testing (within _120 days only_). Coronary CTA was associated with a lower risk of [MI](../Thrombotic%20Disease/ACS.md), but a similar risk of all-cause mortality.

4. **DISCHARGE (NEJM 2022)** compared CCTA with invasive angiography for initial diagnostic strategy in patients with stable chest pain with intermediate pretest probability of obstructive [CAD](../Chronic%20Coronary%20Syndrome.md) who were referred for invasive angiography. This approach had no significant effect on MACE (over 3.5 years) or anginal symptoms, but did show a lower risk of major procedure-related complications and revascularization procedures.

5.  **SCOT-HEART 2** ([pending](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03920176)) investigates whether CTA or risk scores are superior in guiding the use of preventive therapies in asymptomatic patients
