-   Familial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by high serum cholesterol (LDL-specific) at a young age.
-   Associated with early cardiovascular disease.
-   Underlying genetic cause can be identified (80%)

# Epidemiology

-   Very common disease
-   Heterozygous 1:250--500
-   Certain populations: Afrikaners 1:70 and French Canadian 1:200
-   Homozygous 1:1,000,000
-   Underdiagnosis is a global challenge, with only <50% of patients identified

# Importance/Prognosis

-   High risk of mortality due to high concentrations of plasma LDL from birth --> CVD and atherosclerosis
-   Half of untreated heterozygous men and 30% of untreated women will have a myocardial infarction by the age of 50 and 60 years respectively
-   Homozygous --> usually die before the age of 20 (life expectancy 18-32)
-   20% of MIs under age 45 are related to FHC
-   Statins prolong life by approximately nine years

# Pathophysiology

-   Most common (60-80%): LDL receptor (LDLR) mutation, autosomal dominant

-   Mutation: reduced expression or reduced function mainly in hepatocytes
-   Increased serum LDL due to decreased clearance

-   Compromised normal vasodilatory response of arteries
-   Internalization of oxidized LDL by arterial wall macrophages --> intimal inflammation --> atherosclerosis

-   Other mutations: ApoB100, PSCK9

# Diagnosis

-   There is no individual diagnostic test with sufficient specificity and sensitivity to reliably detect familial hypercholesterolaemia
-   Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, family history, and cholesterol measurements
-   Simon Broome Register Group definition of familial hypercholesterolemia

# Clinical Features
-   Relatives with early heart disease
-   Physical examination
	-   Signs are unusual and suspicious before age 45
	-   Tendon/cutaneous xanthomas
		-   Common: dorsum of hands, Achilles
		-   Rarely: extensor hallucis longus and triceps tendons
		-   Classically not present until the third decade of life --> not useful in younger patients
	-   Xanthelasma
		-   lipid deposits underneath the skin on or around the eye­ lids
	-   Premature corneal arcus (a white or grey opaque ring in the corneal margin)
		-   These are normal in older adults

# Investigations
-   Fasting total cholesterol > 7.5 mM
-   Normal TGs
-   Confirm measurements at least twice
-   Cascade screening of first degree relatives
-   Rule out common causes of secondary hypercholesterolemia

# Management

-   Lifestyle advice
-   Risk stratification such as the Framingham score underestimate the risk with this disease
-   Subclinical atherosclerotic disease

-   CT angiography

-   High-dose statin

-   Goal: reduce LDL by >50%
-   Mechanism: HMG-CoA reductase (RDS) inhibitor
-   Promotion of cholesterol intake via increased LDLR (secondary effect)
-   Statins reduce CVD risk in both homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia
