# Background
We know that:
1.  These patients need some sort of protection for stroke risk (from AF), and from in-stent thrombosis (from PCI).
2.  Triple therapy (ASA + P2Y12 + OAC) is effective, but increases bleeding risk.

Therefore, what is the optimal strategy after PCI (elective or for [ACS](../Thrombotic%20Disease/ACS.md)) in patients with AF requiring anticoagulation for their AF (high stroke risk, CHADS2 > 0)?

## Historical Trials
2013 - [WOEST trial](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)62177-1/fulltext) as above. VKA + clopidogrel vs triple therapy. Reduced bleeding but underpowered for thrombosis differences.
2015 - [ISAR-TRIPLE trial](https://www.wikijournalclub.org/wiki/ISAR-TRIPLE) showing triple therapy with 6 weeks of clopidogrel was noninferior to 6 months of clopidogrel (+ASA/VKA)
