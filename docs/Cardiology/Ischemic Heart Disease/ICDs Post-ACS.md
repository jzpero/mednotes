# Key Trials
1.  DINAMIT (2004) (Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial)
2.  IRIS (2009) (Immediate Risk-Stratification Improves Survival)
3.  CABG-Patch

# Trial Summaries
1.  **DINAMIT:** Prophylactic implantation of an ICD 6-40 days after acute [MI](ACS.md) in patients with LV dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 35%) and impaired autonomic function reduces arrhythmic deaths but does not improve all-cause mortality.
	1.  Increased non-arrhythmic death
2.  **IRIS:** Prophylactic ICD therapy did not reduce overall mortality in patients with AMI and clinical features that increased risk of death/SCD (LVEF < 40%, HR > 90 or nonsustained VT on Holter). Timeframe was 5-31 days.
	1.  Decreased SCD
	2.  Increased nonsudden cardiac death
3.  **CABG-Patch** showed no survival benefit with early ICD implantation in high-risk patients who underwent bypass surgery with a low LVEF, presumably because of an altered risk of SCD with revascularization

# Summary
1.  ICDs are generally only recommended for patients with ischemic/non-ischemic CM at least 40 days post-[MI](ACS.md) with reduced EF < 35% and NYHA class II-III symptoms on [Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy](../Heart%20Failure/Guideline-Directed%20Medical%20Therapy.md) with expected survival > 1 year. (IA recommendation)
2.  ICDs are recommended for patients with ischemic CM at least 40 days post-[MI](ACS.md) with reduced EF < 30% and NYHA class I symptoms on [GDMT](../Heart%20Failure/Guideline-Directed%20Medical%20Therapy.md) with expected survival > 1 year. (IB recommendation)
