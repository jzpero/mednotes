# PCI
## REVIVED (2022) - PCI in ischemic HFrEF
REVIVED (in NEJM August 2022) randomized 700 patients with severe LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF <= 35%) from ischemic heart disease in whom revascularization may be reasonable (extensive CAD amenable to PCI, and demonstrable myocardial viability) to PCI+GDMT vs GDMT alone.

There was NO significant difference over 41 months of followup iwith regards to the primary outcome of all-cause mortality + heart failure hospitalization. There was no difference at 6 and 12 months with regards to LVEF. There was no difference in QOL at 24 months.

**SUMMARY:** Among patients with severe ischemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction who received optimal medical therapy, revascularization by PCI did not result in a lower incidence of death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure.

# CABG

# PCI vs CABG
## EXCEL (2009)
CABG likely preferred in the setting of LMCA disease. Due to decreased all-cause death and decreased ischemia-driven revascularization.

## FREEDOM (2012)
In patients with [Diabetes Mellitus](Diabetes%20Mellitus) and multivessel disease, CABG is preferred due to large and significant effect size of composite outcome of decreased death, [MI](ACS.md), and stroke. Driven by decreased death or [MI](ACS.md) independently. However, increased risk of stroke (5.2% vs 2.4%).
