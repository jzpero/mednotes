What is a cardiomyopathy? "A heterogenous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually exhibits inappropriate ventricular hypertorphy or dilation and are due to a variety of causes and frequently are genetic.", per the AHA. However there is no accepted universal definition. 
However, it should exclude:
- secondary to atherosclerotic [CAD](Ischemic%20Heart%20Disease/Chronic%20Coronary%20Syndrome.md)
- valvular disease
- congenital heart disease
- systemic [hypertension](Hypertension.md)

We use phenotypes to identify individuals with a clinical abnormality that fits into a conventional category of cardiomyopathy. These have been associated with specific genotypes, LV and RV functions, electrical dysfunctions:
1. [DCM](Heart%20Failure/Dilated%20Cardiomyopathy.md)
2. ARVC
3. [HCM](Hypertrophic%20Cardiomyopathy.md)
4. RCM
