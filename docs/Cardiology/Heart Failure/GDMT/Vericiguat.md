The **VICTORIA** study assessed the efficacy and safety of the oral soluble guanylate cyclase receptor stimulator, vericiguat, in patients with a reduced EF and recently decompensated CHF. The incidence of the primary endpoint of death from CV causes or hospitalization for HF was lower among those who received vericiguat than among those who received placebo.141Â There was no reduction in either all-cause or CV mortality. Thus, vericiguat may be considered, in addition to standard therapy for HFrEF, to reduce the risk of CV mortality and hospitalizations for HF.
