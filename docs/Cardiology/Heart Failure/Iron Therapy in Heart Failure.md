As a reminder iron deficiency (ID) in HF is commonly defined as either:

1. **ferritin < 100** or
2. **ferritin < 300 and TSAT < 20%**

## Acute Heart Failure
The [**AFFIRM-AHF**](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2021/03/03/17/59/affirming-what-we-know-about-iv-iron-in-patients-with-acute-heart-failure) multicentre RCT showed that treatment with IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) initiated in hospital decreased 1-yr hospitalizations (by 25%) but not mortality in patients with ADHF requiring furosemide 40 mg IV or greater and LVEF < 50%.

Additional data shows that other metrics such as QOL is significantly improved with this approach between 4-24 weeks of treatment initiation as compared to placebo.

## Stable Heart Failure
A [2019 Am. J. Med meta-analysis by Zhou et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2019.02.018) of 10 studies shows that IV iron in stable HFrEF:
   
-   Reduced hospitalizations for worsening HF (5.3 versus 14.5 percent; odds ratio 3.9, 95% CI 0.19-0.80)
-   Improved New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (weighted mean difference [WMD] -0.68, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.24)
-   Improved six-minute walk test (WMD 32.7, 95% CI 4.47-60.83)
-   Improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; WMD 3.81, 95% CI 1.11-6.51)
-   Improved serum markers of HF and inflammation (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and C-reactive protein, respectively)
- These patients were generally NYHA II+ and LVEF <40-50%.

**FAIR-HF (NEJM 2009)** showed that IV iron therapy in patients with symptomatic HFrEF and concomitant iron deficiency (ferritin <100 ug/L or ferritin 100-299 ug/L with iron saturation < 20%) with mild or no anemia (hemoglobin 9.5-13.5 g/dL) resulted in symptomatic improvement or gains in functional status.

## Takeaways
1. In ADHF, you should check for ID and consider treating with IV iron to reduce symptoms and hospitalization. This does not impact mortality. 
    1. You can consider using IV ferric gluconate over several days to accelerate this process and potentially avoid outpatient IV therapy. [Source](https://accpjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/phar.1525)
2. In stable HF(r)EF, IV iron reduces symptoms and biochemical/echocardiographic markers of HF and inflammation. PO iron does not achieve this.
3. Stop iron replacement when ID is resolved as excess iron is cardiotoxic
