# Cardiac [Amyloidosis](../Hematology/Amyloidosis.md)
Caused by deposition of misfolded precursor proteins as fibrillary [amyloid](../Hematology/Amyloidosis.md) deposits in cardiac tissues. The two primary subtypes of systemic [amyloidosis](../Hematology/Amyloidosis.md) causing cardiac involvement are immunoglobulin light chain (AL), a plasma cell dyscrasia, and transthyretin (ATTR).

# Clinical Manifestations
Both have a similar phenotype, notable for increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and an ability to disguise itself clinically as common cardiovascular disease states, including HF, atrial arrhythmias, and aortic stenosis (AS).

# Diagnostic Workup for Cardiac [Amyloidosis](../Hematology/Amyloidosis.md)
![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230215221944.png)

**Consider diagnostic workup for cardiac [amyloidosis](../Hematology/Amyloidosis.md) for patients with HF who have 1+ of the following** (Strong Recommendation, Moderate-Quality Evidence)

- Unexplained increased LV wall thickness
- Age > 60 with low-flow low-gradient AS and LVEF > 40%
- Unexplained peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy and/or dysautonomia
- History of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
- Established AL or ATTR [amyloidosis](../Hematology/Amyloidosis.md)

## Lab Investigations
1. **Troponin:** chronically elevated, AL > ATTR due to myotoxic effect of light chains. Has prognostic value.
2. **NT-proBNP:** chronically elevated, elevated out of proportion of degree of clinical HF.
3. **[Amyloid](../Hematology/Amyloidosis.md) labs:** SPEP and UPEP with immunofixation, sFLC. Indicated in all suspected cases.

## Imaging
1. **Echocardiogram:** incr RV/LV thickness, preserved ventricular size, BiAE, diastolic dysfunction, increased valvular and IAS thickness, small PCE, and reduced LV GLS with preserved apical strain
2. **Cardiac MR:** diffuse trasmural or subendocardial pattern of LGE, etc
3. **Pyrophosphate nuclear scintigraphy:** perform this if AL [amyloid](../Hematology/Amyloidosis.md) is ruled out and ATTR cardiac [amyloidosis](../Hematology/Amyloidosis.md) is suspected
