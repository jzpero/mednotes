## Adaptive Erythrocytosis
Adaptive erythrocytosis is well tolerated in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease.

Therapeutic phlebotomy is indicated with symptomatic hyperviscosity (headaches, reduced concentration) with a hemoglobin level greater than 20 g/dL (200 g/L) and hematocrit greater than 65% in the absence of dehydration.
