# Background
Triglyceride (TG) metabolism can produce a by-product called remnant lipoproteins, which can be atherogenic. Most guidelines consider hypertriglyceridemia to start at values â‰¥ 150 mg/dl. It is the most common dyslipidemia, as it can occur in 30% of the general population. Although fasting levels are usually obtained per the current US protocol, there is evidence that non-fasting TG levels might be a better indicator of cardiovascular (CV) risk as these levels may better reflect the usual levels that the body is exposed to.

# Causes of HyperTG
- primary
	- familial hyperTG
	- familial combined hyperlipidemia
	- familial dysbetalipoproteinemia
	- familial chylomicronemia
	- lipodystrophic syndromes
- secondary
	- diet, decreased physical activity, smoking
	- diabetes, alcohol abuse, hypothyroidism, pregnancy
	- thiazides, non-selective beta blockers, antipsychotics, glucocorticoids
	- estrogen and estrogen receptor blockers
	- propofol
	- interferon
	- cancer therapies

# Treatment
*In summary, consider addition of EPA when triglycerides are still elevated on maximally tolerated statin therapy.* As well, address underlying possible causes of hyperTG as above.

1. **JELIS (2007)** - 19% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular events when 1.8g daily of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was added to low-intensity statin therapy, for patients with hypercholesteremia and age 40-75
3. **REDUCE-IT (2018)** - icosapent ethyl ester (EPA) led to a reduction in ASCVD events in secondary prevention patients and high risk primary prevention patients with DM and residual elevated TGs on top of maximally tolerated statin therapy
1. **STRENGTH (2021)** - omega-3 CA (EPA+DHA) in addition to statin for patients with DLD and high ASCVD risk did NOT reduce MACE
