> [!info] **SPRINT, or "High-Risk" Population:**
> SBP > 130 and one of:
> 1) Age 50+ with clinical or subclinical CVD, eGFR 20-60, proteinuria < 1 g/d, 10-year CV risk 15%+
> 2) Age 75+

# Pharmacotherapy
## First-Line Therapy
- Single-Pill Combinations (SPCs):
	- ACEi + CCB preferred.
	- ARB + CCB
	- ACE/ARB + diuretic
- Diuretics: long-acting TDs (chlorthalidone, indapamide) preferred over HCTZ
- ACE/ARB
- Long-acting CCB
- Beta-blockers (if young or with CVD)

## Second-Line Therapy
- add on drugs from the first-line choices:
	- thiazide + DHP-CCB
	- DHP-CCB + ACEi
- avoid:
	- ACE + ARBC
	- Dilt/verapamil + Beta blocker

## Specific Population Therapies
| Population | Recommendations                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Diabetes   | ACE/ARB (especially with albuminuria or CKD), DHP-CCB, thiazide. If combination therapy with ACEi is needed, a DHP-CCB is preferred over a thiazide. |

# Major Hypertension Trials
![](_attachments/fcvm-03-00003-t001.jpg)

## SHEP (1991)
## DASH (1997)
## ALLHAT (2002)
RCT to determine whether the occurrence of fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction ([MI](Ischemic%20Heart%20Disease/ACS.md)) is lower for high-risk patients with hypertension treated with amlodipine, lisinopril, doxazosin, or chlorthalidone.

Upon analysis of the data, the primary outcome, fatal coronary artery disease or nonfatal [MI](Ischemic%20Heart%20Disease/ACS.md) at 6 years, was similar among all groups. There was also no significant difference in all-cause mortality, a secondary outcome, among the groups.
- When comparing amlodipine with chlorthalidone, the amlodipine group had a 38% higher risk of heart failure (HF) (P<.001) and a 35% higher risk of hospitalized/fatal HF (P<.001).
- When comparing lisinopril with chlorthalidone, the lisinopril group had a 15% higher risk for stroke (P=.02), a 10% higher risk of combined cardiovascular disease (CVD) (p<0.001), a 19% higher risk of HF (P<.001), and an 11% higher risk of hospitalized/treated angina (P=.01).

As a result, **the authors of the study concluded that thiazide-type diuretics are superior in preventing CVD** and recommended that they be preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy. Because of results from the study, the JNC 7 hypertension guidelines recommended that diuretics should be initiated in stage I hypertension.

## ACCOMPLISH (2008)
In patients with hypertension at high risk for cardiovascular complications, the combination of benazepril-amlodipine is superior to benazepril-hydrochlorothiazide in reducing cardiovascular events.

## ACCORD (2010)
In diabetic, is SBP < 120 better than < 140? No significant difference in mortality, total CV events, or renal protection.

## SPRINT (2015)
Among patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes, intensive blood pressure control to a target SBP <120 mmHg improves cardiovascular outcomes but increases the rates of some adverse events.
