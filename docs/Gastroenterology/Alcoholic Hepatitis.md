# Alcoholic Hepatitis
## Treatment of ETOH Hepatitis
### Deciding to Treat
We mainly use the the **Maddrey discriminant function (DF)** which is an objective measure based on the INR, bilirubin, etc. Maddrey DF ≥ 32 indicates severe ETOH hepatitis with high mortality risk and would likely benefit from specific treatment.

### Treatment Regimens
#### Picking a Regimen
The STOPAH trial (2015)[^1] compared prednisolone, pentoxyfylline, or a combination of both in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis, and looked at 28-day mortality as a primary outcome.

#### Prednisolone

Contraindications to prednisolone treatment: active proven or suspected infection.

#### Pentoxyfylline

### Response to Treatment
We mainly use the **Lille score** which is derived from changes in bilirubin in response to steroid treatment of ETOH hepatitis.
