# Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis
## Microbiology and Pathogenesis

-   SBP develops in patients with severe ascites, usually due to cirrhosis, but also from:

    -   CHF

    -   Malignancy

    -   Lymphedema

-   Bacteria enter the peritoneal space through the blood, lymphatic fluid, transluminal passage

-   In severe cirrhosis, the RES liver system is often bypassed secondary to shunting, increasing the risk of prolonged bacteremia. The bowel motility is also decreased, resulting in bacterial overgrowth

-   **Most common pathogens**

    -   Enteric bowel flora

    -   E coli

    -   Klebsiella

    -   Strep pneumoniae

    -   Enterococcus

 

## Clinical Manifestations

-   Subtle initial signs and symptoms

-   **Fever** is the most common manifestation, and is usually low grade

-   **Abdominal pain** can be diffuse and constant

    -   No guarding

    -   The ascites separates the peritoneum, preventing severe inflammatory irritation of the abdominal wall muscles

    -   Rebound tenderness in late stages

-   **AMS**, from exacerbated hepatic encephalopathy

-   **Diarrhea** might precede other symptoms

 

# Diagnosis

-   **Ascitic fluid must be sampled (paracentesis)**

    -   Needle aspiration

    -   Significant bleeding only occurs in less than 1% of patients, despite a high INR in many cases

    -   Paracentesis is minimally traumatic and does not require ppx plasma transfusions

    -   Samples:

        -   \(1\) Take at least 10 ml of ascitic fluid into a blood culture flask. Change needles before you do this to avoid growing skin flora.

        -   \(2\) Take a second sample into an anticoagulated tube for cell counts

        -   \(3\) total protein, LDH, glucose, amylase, albumin

        -   \(4\) Gram stain

-   **Interpretation**

    -   Leukocytes almost always &gt; 300 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, with PMN predominance

        -   The diagnosis is strongly suggested if the absolute PMN count is over 250/mm<sup>3</sup>

        -   Can test using a UA leuk esterase strip &gt; 21

    -   Gram stain is positive in 20-40% of cases

    -   The following suggests <u>secondary peritonitis from bowel perforation</u>

        -   High total protein

        -   High LDH

        -   High amylase

        -   Low glucose

 

# Treatment

-   **Empiric antibiotics** need to be emergently started after cultures obtained

    -   3rd generation cephalosporin

    -   If secondary peritonitis suspected, add metronidazole

    -   Treat for 5-10 days depending on response to therapy

 

# Outcome

-   Mortality is high (60-70%) due to severe underlying liver disease and the severity of this type of infection

-   There is benefit to early diagnosis

-   Strongly consider liver transplant for first episode spontaneous peritonitis

 

# Prophylaxis

-   **Antibiotic ppx is indicated after the first episode**

    -   Regimens:

        -   TMP-SMX 1 ds tab once daily

        -   Norfloxacin 400 mg once daily

        -   Ciprofloxacin 500 mg once daily

-   **Stop beta blockers** after the first episode

    -   Patients may be on NSBB such as propranolol, nadolol, or also carvedilol.

    -   Increase mortality, increase rates of hepatorenal syndrome, increase hospitalizations
