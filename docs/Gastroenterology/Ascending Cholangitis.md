# Ascending Cholangitis
## Definition

-   Life-threatening complication of gallstones

-   Usually caused by impacted stone in the bile duct that predisposes to bacterial infection --&gt; septicemia

-   Most common organisms:

    -   E coli

    -   Klebsiella

    -   Pseudomonas

    -   Enterococcus

 

## Clinical Features

-   Typical symptoms (**Charcot's Triad**):

    -   \(1\) Fever

    -   \(2\) Jaundice

    -   \(3\) RUQ pain

-   Less frequent symptoms (10-20%) (**Reynaud's pentad**)

    -   \(4\) Altered mental status

    -   \(5\) Hypotension

    -   *These are associated with higher mortality and morbidity than Charcot's triad alone*

 

## Diagnosis

-   Labs

    -   Leukocytosis with left shift

    -   Hyperbilirubinemia

    -   Elevated ALP and AST/ALT

-   Imaging

    -   CT &gt; US accuracy

        -   These are not good for exclusion of BD stone

    -   ERCP for diagnosis and therapy

    -   MRCP

 

## Treatment

-   **Broad spectrum antibiotics**

    -   Most cases: single IV abx like cefoxitin

    -   Severe cases: use similar abx like acute cholecystitis

    -   Adjust according to blood cultures

-   **Biliary decompression**

    -   Urgency depends on response to supportive therapy and abx

    -   Modality:

        -   Hemodynamically stable: ERCP

        -   Hemodynamically unstable: percutaneous cholecystostomy tube

-   **Cholecystectomy** to prevent further gallstone formation or migration
