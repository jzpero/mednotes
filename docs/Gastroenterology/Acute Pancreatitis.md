# Diagnosis and Classification
**Atlanta criteria** for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP), classically need 2 of 3:
1. Lipase or amylase > 3x ULN
2. Typical pain syndrome
3. Radiographic demonstration of pancreatic inflammation

## Risk Stratification
- BISAP
- APACHE II
- Ranson's criteria
- SOFA

## Classification

## Etiologies
1. Gallstone
2. Alcohol
3. Medications
	1. DPP4 inhibitors
	2. ACE inhibitors

# Management
## Antibiotics
- no role for routine prophylactic antibiotics in AP.

## Enteral Feeding
- evidence suggests that early enteral feeding is superior. An initial low-fat full diet at the time of diagnosis has been shown to possible reduce LOS, improve pain, and is not inferior to a standard graduated dietary approach.

## Fluid Management
- historical paradigm dictates that due to inflammation, aggressive large volume fluid resuscitation is mandated for these patients
- **WATERFALL (NEJM 2022)** trial [@de-madariaAggressiveModerateFluid2022] demonstrates that for mild pancreatitis, a restrictive fluid resuscitation approach is non-inferior and may be better than a liberal fluid approach: 
	- Outcomes:
		- reduced progression to moderate and severe pancreatitis
		- reduced iatrogenic fluid overload
	- Strategy:
		- Fluid bolus: only given initially for hypovolemia
		- Maintenance: 3 mL/kg/hr (liberal) vs 1.5 mL/kg/hr (restrictive)
		- Endpoint: 

## Trending Pancreatic Enzymes
- no role for routinely re-checking and trending lipase or amylase in AP

## Complications
1. [ARDS](../Critical%20Care/ARDS/Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md)
2. Pancreatic pseudocyst
