# Portal Hypertension
## Definition

-   Portal HTN:
    -   Results from increased resistance or increased portal blood flow
    -   When caused by sinusoidal damage from liver disease, defined as an increase in the pressure gradient between the portal vein and the hepatic vein
    -   Key consequence of cirrhosis and can result in life-threatening complications

## Pathophysiology

-   **Normal portal circulation**

    -   Portal venous system: delivers blood directly to the liver from the organs in nutrient digestion

    -   Portal vein: formed by the confluence of the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein

    -   High compliance, low-resistance system: allows large volume flow without changes in portal venous pressure

    -   The hepatic artery converges with the portal vein to flow into the hepatic sinusoids and constitutes 30% of cardiac output (dual-supply)

-   **Hemodynamic changes**

    -   Portal HTN results from :

        -   Increased portal resistance

        -   Increased portal blood flow

    -   In cirrhosis:

        -   **Increased intrahepatic resistance**

            -   Fixed component

                -   Distortion of the intrahepatic microcirculation by sinusoidal fibrosis and compression by regenerative nodules

            -   Functional components

                -   Intrahepatic vasoconstriction due to contraction of hepatic stellate cells and myofibroblasts

                -   Increased production of vasoconstrictors (endothelins)

                -   Reduced production of vasodilator (nitrous oxide)

        -   **Increased portal blood flow**

            -   Increased portal pressures induce overproduction of NO in splanchnic endothelial cells

            -   Progressive splanchnic vasodilation and increased portal flow

    -   Hyperdynamic circulatory syndrome

        -   Decreased SVR, decreased MAP, increased cardiac index

    -   Decreased pressure detected by baroreceptors (carotid and renal)

        -   <u>Activation of RAAS and ADH</u>

        -   Increased sodium and water retention

        -   May lead to ascites and hepatorenal syndrome

    -   <u>Portosystemic collaterals</u> develop to decompress the increased portal HTN

        -   Hemorrhage from gastroesophageal varices

-   **Classification and Causes of Portal HTN**

    -   NA and Europe: most common cause is cirrhosis

    -   Other causes:

        -   Extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis

        -   Schistosomiasis

-   **Measurement of portal pressure**

    -   HVPG is a measurement of portal pressure

        -   Independent measure of variceal hemorrhage and death

        -   Measurement: transjugular/femoral approach

        -   Normal range: 3-5 mmHg

        -   Portal HTN is defined as HVPG &gt;6 mmHg

 

# Variceal Hemorrhage

-   **Definition**

    -   Present in 50% of patients with cirrhosis

    -   Presence corresponds to severity of liver disease

    -   Aggressive and early management is essential (mortality is 15-20%)

-   **Pathophysiology**

    -   Portosystemic collaterals open to decompress the increased portal HTN

        -   Opening of preexisting vessels or by angiogenesis

        -   Reversal of preexisting flow

    -   <u>Variceal wall tension</u> is the main factor determining the risk of variceal hemorrhage and correlates with vessel diameter and pressure within the vessel

        -   Hemorrhage possible when HVPG &gt;= 12 mmHg

-   **Clinical and Laboratory Findings**

    -   Presentation

        -   Large-volume hematemesis and/or melena

        -   Stigmata of chronic liver disease and GI hemorrhage

        -   Hypovolemic shock

    -   Laboratory findings

        -   Chronic liver disease and portal HTN:

            -   Prolonged PT, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia

-   **Diagnosis**

    -   <u>EDG (esophagogastroduodenoscopy)</u>

        -   Reveals gastric or esophageal varices

        -   Identification of active bleeding and/or stigmata of high hemorrhage risk

            -   Pigmented "cherry red" spots

            -   Longitudinal "red wale" streaks/signs

-   **Treatment**

    -   <u>Acute variceal bleeding</u>

        -   ICU + hemodynamic stabilization

        -   Symptomatic transfusions

    -   <u>Pharmacologic therapy</u>

        -   Octreotide (somatostatin analogue)

            -   Splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduction of portal blood flow

            -   Adjunct to endoscopic therapy

        -   Antibiotic

            -   Reduction of bacterial infection risk including spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

            -   Ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolone (5-7 days)

    -   <u>Endoscopic therapy</u>

        -   ASAP when hemodynamically stable

        -   <u>Endoscopy variceal ligation</u> (EVL) w/ "rubber band" strangulation of the varix

    -   <u>Balloon tamponade</u>

        -   Used for hemorrhaging varices secondary to EVL

        -   Short-term hemostasis

        -   Inflation of gastric and esophageal balloon sequentially

        -   Is not a definite treatment

    -   <u>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)</u>

        -   Considered for uncontrolled esophageal variceal hemorrhage after failed pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy

        -   Creation of a communication between the hepatic vein and an intrahepatic branch of the portal vein

        -   Reduction of portal pressure

-   **Prevention of Variceal Hemorrhage**

    -   <u>Primary prophylaxis:</u>

        -   *<u>Nonselective beta blockers (NSBB)</u>* (decreases portal venous inflow via unopposed vasoconstriction in the mesenteric arterioles); or

        -   *<u>EVL</u>* to decrease risk of hemorrhage

    -   <u>Secondary prophylaxis:</u>

        -   Combination therapy: *<u>NSBB + serial EVL</u>*

        -   *<u>TIPS</u>*
