Asthma is a heterogenous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Symptoms include wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and are related to bronchoconstriction, airway wall thickening, increased mucus and variable expiratory airflow limitation.

# Diagnosis of Asthma
- Diagnosis requires a:
	- **History of variable symptoms** (wheeze, SOB, chest tightness, cough) which are variable over time and variable in intensity; often worse at night or on waking; often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens, and cold air; worsened with viral infections.
	- **Confirmed variable expiratory airflow limitation**
		- (1) **Positive spirometry with reversible airway obstruction:** FEV1/FVC < LLN; and increase in FEV1 after bronchodilator or after a course of controller therapy of >=12% and a minimum of 200 mL
		- (2) **Peak expiratory flow**
			- \>60LPM (min 20%) increase after bronchodilator or after a course of controller therapy
			- Diurnal variation > 8% based on twice-daily readings, or >20% based on multiple daily readins
		- (3) **Positive challenge test** 
			- Methacholine PC20 <4 mg/mL or PD20 <0.5 umol

1. **Expiratory airflow limitation**, at least once during the diagnostic process, confirmed with reduced FEV1/FVC below the LLN
2. **Variability,** demonstrated by one of:
	1. Positive bronchodilator reversibility (10-15 minutes post 200-400 mcg salbutamol) -- improvement in FEV1 by >12% and 200 mL post BD
	2. Improvement with anti-inflammatory treatment x 4 weeks -- improvement in FEV1 by >12% and 200 mL
	3. Excessive FEV1 variation in lung function between visits (improvement in FEV1 by >12% and 200 mL)
	4. Peak flow variability > 10%
	5. Positive bronchial challenge test
		1. Methacholine challenge. Look for a drop in FEV1 by 20%:
			1. PC20 < 4 mg/mL = positive
			2. PC20 4 - 16 = borderline
			3. PC20 > 16 negative
		2. Exercise challenge: fall in FEV of >10% and 200 mL

## Asthma Mimics
- Bronchiectasis
- Cystic Fibrosis
- [EGPA](../../Rheumatology/ANCA%20Associated%20Vasculitis.md)
- Vocal cord dysfunction
- [ABPA](../Allergic%20Bronchopulmonary%20Aspergillosus%20(ABPA).md)
- Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) -- acute irritant induced asthma following a single high dose exposure to irritant. Lasts >3 months. Treat like an asthma exacerbation

# Assessing Control
Control is the goal of asthma management (i.e. symptoms and risk of adverse outcomes). Assess at each visit. Asthma control implies all of the following CTS criteria:

## Uncontrolled vs Severe Asthma
- uncontrolled: poor symptom control, frequent exacerbations, severe hospitalization in the past year, sustained airflow reduction. Usually due to poor adherence, technique, or ongoing trigger.
- Severe (5% of patients): requiring treatment with high-dose ICS + 2nd controller for the previous year, or oral steroids for 50% of the year, to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled. Please refer for specialty consultation and add-on therapies.

# Asthma Treatment (GINA 2023)
## Reliever Medication
1. Low-dose ICS + SABA (e.g. budesonide-formoterol -- Symbicort) is the preferred reliever medication for all asthmatics.
	- based on the principle that asthma is an inflammatory condition
	- SABA PRN alone increases the risk of exacerbation, decreased lung function, severe exacerbations.
	- **SYGMA 1 + 2 trials (NEJM 2018)** showed that PRN Symbicort is superior to SABA PRN in reducing exacerbations (64%) and non-inferior to maintenance ICS + PRN SABA.
2. Alternative reliever: PRN SABA

## Non-Pharmacological 
- confirm diagnosis, asthma action plan
- weight loss, exercise training
- allergen and trigger avoidance, allergen immunotherapy
- smoking cessation
- vaccinations
- avoid NSAIDs/beta blockers if possible

## LTRA
- may be appropriate as initial controlled if ICS not possible for some reasons, but less effective than ICS at prevention exacerbations.
	- most effective in aspirin-exacerbated asthma, exercise-induced symptoms, allergic rhinitis
	- FDA black box warning: increased suicidality in adolescents and adults
- LABA-ICS is superior to ICS-LTRA for those stepping up from low-dose ICS maintenance

## Management of Severe Asthma
- **Workup**
	- Total IgE
	- peripheral eosinophil count
	- sputum eosinophilis and FeNO where available
- **Treatment (see above GINA table)**
	- tiotropium mist inhaler --> increases time to first severe exacerbation
	- Macrolides if uncontrolled despite ICS/LABA. **LANCET AMAZES trial 2017**
	- Biologics
	- Low-dose OCS
	- Bronchial thermoplasty
