Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is due to a mechanical load on the respiratory pump system and a blunted ventilatory response to CO2.
# Pathophysiology of OHS
OHS can lead to biventricular heart failure, [pulmonary hypertension](../Pulmonary%20Hypertension.md).
# Diagnosis of OHS
1. Daytime hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 45 mmHg)
2. Obesity
3. Exclusion of other causes of hypoventilation
# Treatment of OHS
1. Weight loss is essential: [Obesity](../../Endocrinology/Obesity/Obesity.md) management via lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, and surgery if indicated.
2. CPAP is indicated for stable ambulatory patients with OHS and concomitant severe OSA (AHI > 30).
3. BiPAP (+/- ST) or PSV is indicated for inpatients with OHS-related respiratory failure, which should be continued as an outpatient until the patient can be evaluated with a PSG and titrated with the appropriate PAP. Patients may need supplemental O2.
