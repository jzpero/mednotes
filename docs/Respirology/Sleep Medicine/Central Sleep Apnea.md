Central Sleep Apnea (CSA) is defined by apnea caused by a *loss of output from the central respiratory centres in the brainstem to the respiratory muscles*. In CSA, the hypercapneic response is *exaggerated* --> ventilatory overshoot --> hyperventilation --> hypocapnea --> cessation of respiratory drive.
# Risk Factors
- Primary CSA is uncommon.
- Secondary CSA is due to an underlying condition that destabilizes the ventilatory control system in the brainstem:
	- *Heart failure* (most common) which manifests as Cheyne-Stokes breathing
	- *Atrial fibrillation* with and without HF
	- Opioid analgesics
	- *"Treatment-emergent CSA"* is an entity which manifests as patients with OSA are treated with PAP (in about 10% of cases) --> many cases resolve as patients acclimate to regular PAP
	- Stroke, brainstem lesions
	- High-altitude period breathing (a form of [Altitude Related Illness](../Altitude%20Related%20Illness.md))
# Diagnosis of CSA
On polysomnography, *central apnea is identified by the absence of respiratory effort associated with loss of airflow for at least 10 seconds.*

Note: the AHI is not validated as a predictor of important clinical outcomes in CSA as it has been in OSA.
# Treatment of CSA
1. Treat underlying risk factors:
	1. Reduce opioids
	2. Optimize heart failure (shown to improve CSA and Cheyne-Stokes)
2. PAP for those with concomitant [OSA](Obstructive%20Sleep%20Apnea.md), especially with "adaptive servo-ventilation" (ASV) that effectively suppresses CSA. However, a trial ([Cowie et al NEJM 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26323938/)) showed an increased in mortality in patients with CSA and HFrEF treated with ASV --> avoid in HFrEF for now.
3. Supplemental oxygen for sleep-related hypoxia
