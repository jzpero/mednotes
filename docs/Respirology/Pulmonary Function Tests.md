PFTs consist of:
1) Spirometry
2) Lung volumes
3) Diffusion capacity

# Basic Approach
1. Identification. The norms are now based on four features
	1. Age
	2. Sex
	3. Height
	4. Ethnicity
2. Flow-volume loop
	1. Quality
	2. Defects/Scooping
	3. Obstructions (intrathoracic, extrathoracic, fixed)
3. Spirometry
	1. FEV1
	2. FEV1/VC
4. Lung Volumes
	1. TLC
	2. RV
	3. RV/TLC
5. Diffusion capacity
	1. DLCO
	2. KCO

# Interpretation of PFTs
## Obstructive Defects
Do NOT use FEV1/VC of 0.70 as a cut-off. Use the LLN due to:
1) Racial/ethnic variations
2) Age variations in FEV1 and FVC

## Non-Obstructive Defects

## Restrictive Defect
Decreased TLC and decreased VC

## DLCO
1. Decreased DLCO differential:
	1. [Pulmonary hypertension](Pulmonary%20Hypertension.md)
	2. Decreased cardiac output
	3. Emphysema
	4. Early interstitial lung disease
