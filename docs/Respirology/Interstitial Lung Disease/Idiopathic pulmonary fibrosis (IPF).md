aliases: [IPF]

# Background
- the most common IIP
- Epidemiology:
	- M>F
	- 6th or 7th decade of life, rare < 50
- Chronic, progressive, fibrotic ILD defined by the histologic/radiologic pattern of Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP)

# Diagnosis of IPF
- Requires:
	- exclusion of other known causes of ILD
	- demonstration of **UIP pattern** on HRCT
		- subpleural, basal predominant reticular changes, often heterogenous distribution.
		- honeycombing +/- peripheral traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis
	- Specific combinations of HRCT pattern and histopathologic patterns in patients subject to tissue biopsy
- Send serologic testing: ANA, RF, anti-CCP, +/- myositis panel +/- Rheum referral.
- MDD (multidisciplinary discussion) to decide whether further diagnosis (bronchoscopy and BAL, surgical lung biopsy, etc) are required

# Treatment of IPF
## Acute Exacerbations of IPF
Defined as worsening SOB, hypoxemia with new diffuse bilateral GGO on CT. 

Management:
- Rule out infection/PE/HF
- Consider high dose steroids (1 g/d x 3 --> 1 mg/kg PO daily) and empiric antimicrobials.
- Discuss goals of care: 50% in-hospital mortality

## Long-Term Management
### Non-Targeted
1. Smoking cessation
2. Oxygen therapy
3. PPI
4. Pulmonary rehab
5. Vaccinations (Pneumococcus, influenza, COVID)
6. Advanced care planning

### Anti-Fibrotic Medications
Choice is mainly based on side effects and on patient preference.

| Medication  | Trials          | MOA          | Benefits                                         | Adverse Effects |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Nintendanib | INPULSIS 1/2    | TK inhibitor | Reduces FVC decline, trend to reduced mortality. | Diarrhea, GI upset, transaminitis.                |
| Pirfenidone | ASCEND/CAPACITY |              |                                                  |                 |

### Immunomodulation in IPF
There is *no role for long-term immunosuppression in IPF*, given increased mortality (per **PANTHER-IPF** trial which examined prednisone, azathioprine, and NAC).

## Transplant Referral
Consider early referral for IPF and fibrotic NSIP. The criteria are:
- FVC < 80%
- DLCO < 40%
- Needs oxygen
- Failed pharmacotherapy
