# Hemodynamic Definitions
| Group                        | mPAP | PVR | PCWP  | Causes |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | --- | ----- | ------ |
| Isolated pre-capillary       | > 20 | > 2 | <= 15 |        |
| Isolated post-capillary      | > 20 | < 2 | > 15  |        |
| Mixed pre and post-capillary | > 20  | >2  | > 15  |        |

- PH defined as mPAP > 20 mmHg
- old definition: PVR > 3 Woods units, now >2 Woods units (2022)
- Normal mPAP is 14 +/- 3 mmHg in normal populations.
- Pre- vs post-capillary: breakpoint PCWP is 15 mmHg.
