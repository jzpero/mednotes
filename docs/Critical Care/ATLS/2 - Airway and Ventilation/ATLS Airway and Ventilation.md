# ATLS Airway and Ventilation
Securing a compromised airway, delivering oxygen, and supporting ventilation take priority over management of all other conditions. Supplemental oxygen must be administered to all severely injured trauma patients.

# Airway
Airway compromise can be dynamic, late presenting, and insidious. Frequently reassess by talking to the patient. Is their verbal response adequate and clear?

- Consider early [intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md) for decreased neurologic status, airway burns.
- Midfacial trauma can lead to fractures and dislocations that compromise the nasopharynx and oropharynx, leading to loss of airway structural support.
	- increased risk with providing anesthesia and sedation due to loss of muscle tone
	- consider early [intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md)
- Neck trauma (blunt, penetrating) can lead to massive neck hematomas with respiratory compromise. May need a surgical airway.
- Tracheal or laryngeal injury can cause sudden complete occlusion. Consider surgical airway support.

# Ventilation
A definitive airway requires a tube placed in the trachea with the cuff inflated below the
vocal cords, the tube connected to some form of oxygen-enriched assisted ventilation, and
the airway secured in place with an appropriate stabilization method.

Consider having RSI medications and airway cart ready to go prior to the patient arriving.
