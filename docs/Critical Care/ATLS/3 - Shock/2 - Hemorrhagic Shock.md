# 2 - Hemorrhagic Shock
Hemorrhage is an acute loss of circulating blood volume. Normal BV is approx 7% of IBW, or 70-80 mL/kg for children.

| Class                | Definition                                                                                                                                                                | Estimated Blood Loss | Clinical Clues |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Class I hemorrhage   | <1 unit of blood                                                                                                                                                          | <15%                 |  Minimal, can have some tachycardia              |
| Class II hemorrhage  | uncomplicated hemorrhage requiring IV fluids                                                                                                                              | 15-30%               | narrow pulse pressure, elevated DBP. Subtle CNS changes               |
| Class III hemorrhage | complicated hemorrhage; crystalloids are mandated and consider blood as well                                                                                              | 31-40%               | AMS, decr SBP, narrow pulse pressure               |
| Class IV hemorrhage  | preterminal event, the patient will die within minutes. Blood transfusion ([Massive Transfusion](../../Shock%20and%20Resuscitation/Massive%20Transfusion.md)) is required | >40%                 |                |

Modifying factors for recognizing shock: patient age (extremes of age), severity of injury, time lapse between injury and initiation of treatment, prehospital fluid therapy, and medications for chronic conditions (antihypertensive, beta blockers, etc).

# Initial Management of Hemorrhagic Shock
1. ABCDEs
2. Vascular access, initial bloodwork.
3. Initial fluid therapy (warmed isotonic crystalloids): 1 litre for adults and 20 mL/kg for pediatric patients <40 kg
4. Consider "controlled resuscitation" - permissive hypotension to reduce bleeding risk as a bridge to definitive control of bleeding.

# Transfusion in Hemorrhagic Shock
1. Crossmatched blood is preferred.
2. Unmatched type-specific is next.
3. Type O pRBC are indicated if needed urgently
	1. Rh-negative for females of child-bearing age
	2. Rh agnostic otherwise!
4. Tranfuse PRN and carefully according to clinical status and coagulation/CBC studies, consider activation of [Massive Transfusion](../../Shock%20and%20Resuscitation/Massive%20Transfusion.md) protocol.
	1. TXA: 1g x 1 within 3 hours, and 1g over 8 hours afterwards
	2. Calcium administration
	3. Avoid hypothermia
	4. Aggressively treat acidosis
