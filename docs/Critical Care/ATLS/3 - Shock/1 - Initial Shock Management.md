# 1 - Shock Management
The first step in managing shock is to recognize shock. The definition of shock is circulatory dysfunction resulting in hypoperfusion and tissue ischemia. This is a clinical and laboratory diagnosis.

# Shock Pathophysiology
- Cardiac output = SV x HR
- SV is determined by preload, contractility, and afterload.
- Preload is determined by the balance between venous capacitance, volume status, and the difference between MAP and RAP.
- Initial responses to shock are compensatory and may only manifest as tachycardia.

# Initial Patient Assessment
1. **Recognize Shock** - this is NOT just hypotension as patients can lose up to 30% of blood volume before there are measurable changes in SBP
	1. Pulse pressure, heart rate, pulse character, respiratory rate, skin perfusion, mental status
	2. Tachycardia: >160 in infants, >160 in pre-school children, >120 in school aged kids, and >100 in adults
	3. Massive blood loss will not produce an immediate large decrease in Hb/Hct
	4. Consider lactate trending/measurements
2. **What is the cause of shock?**
	1. In trauma patients this is usually related to the mechanism of injury.
	2. **Hemorrhagic shock** - most common in trauma, and you need to identify and treat the hemorrhage. Where is the patient bleeding? 
	3. **Non-hemorrhagic shock**
		1. cardiogenic shock - blunt cardiac injury, cardiac tamponade, air embolism, acute myocardial infarction
		2. neurogenic shock - *isolated intracranial injuries do not cause shock unless the brainstem is injured*. Spinal injuries (cervical and upper thoracic) can lead to spinal shock w/o tachycardia or peripheral vasoconstriction (normal pulse pressure).
		3. septic shock - suspect in delayed presentation or if history suggests underlying infection
		4. tension PTX - Beck's triad + decreased breath sounds, hyperresonant percussion
	4. Consider also neurogenic/spinal shock, brainstem injury, sepsis, hypovolemia, cardiogenic, obstructive.
