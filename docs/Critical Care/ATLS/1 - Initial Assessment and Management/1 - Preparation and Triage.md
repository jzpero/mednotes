# Preparation and Triage
This occurs in the field and in the hospital.

# Preparation 
## Prehospital Phase
In this phase, the receiving hospital is notified before the patient is transported from the scene. This allows for mobilization of the trauma team members so everyone is present in the ER at the time of the patient's arrival.

In this phase, airway maintenance, control of external bleeding and shock, immobilization, and immediate transport is prioritized. Scene time is minimized.

Who should be transported to a trauma center?

1. GCS 13 or less, SBP 90 or less, respiratory rate less than 10 or greater than 29, or needs ventilatory support.
2. Penetrating injury to the head, neck, torso and extremities proximal to the elbow and knee
3. Chest wall instability, or deformity
4. Two or more proximal long bone fractures
5. Crushed or deformed extremity
6. Linda, amputation, proximal to wrist or ankle
7. Pelvic fractures
8. Open or depressed skull fractures
9. Paralysis
10. Falls >20 feet in adults and >10 feet in children
11. High risk motor vehicle crashes
12. Auto versus non-auto pedestrian with significant impact
13. Motorcycle crashes
14. Older adults
15. Children
16. Anticoagulant use and bleeding disorders
17. Burns
18. Pregnancy > 20 weeks
19. EMS provider judgement

## Hospital Phase
Handover between pre-hospital providers and receiving hospital providers should be smooth and directed by the trauma team leader.

Ensure the following are present: resuscitation area, functional and accessible airway equipment, warmed IV crystalloid solutions and monitoring devices, protocols to summon additional medical assistance, including laboratory and radiology personnel.

# Triage
- this involves the sorting of patients based on the resources required for treatment, and the resources that are actually available.
- the order of treatment is based on the ABC priorities
- **multiple casualties:** the number of patients and the severity of their injuries do not exceed the capability of the facility to render care. Patients with life-threatening problems, and those  sustaining multiple system injuries are treated first.
- **Mass casualties:** the number of patients and the severity of their injuries exceeds the capability of the facility and staff. Patients with the greatest chance of survival and requiring the least expenditure of resources are treated first.
