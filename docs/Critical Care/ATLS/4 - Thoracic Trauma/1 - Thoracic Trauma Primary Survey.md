Less than 10% of blunt chest injuries and only 15% to 30% of penetrating chest injuries
require operative intervention. Most patients who sustain thoracic trauma can be treated by technical procedures within the capabilities of clinicians trained in ATLS.

*Most life-threatening thoracic injuries can be treated with airway control or decompression of the chest with a needle, finger, or tube.*
