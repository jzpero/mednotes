Septic shock leads to organ hypoperfusion through a combination of vasodilatory shock, cardiac depression, microcirculatory dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction.

## BP Targets in Septic Shock
Overall the data suggest a minimum MAP of 65 mmHg in septic shock. A MAP target that is too low may be associated with organ hypoperfusion, whereas one that is too high may be associated with ischemic injury due to excessive vasoconstriction.

The **SEPSISPAM (NEJM 2014)** trial compared BP targets in septic shock (MAP 80-85 vs 65-70 mmHg). There was no difference in 28-d mortality, 90-d mortality, serious adverse events. There was slightly increased atrial fibrillation with a higher target. There was  slightly less RRT in patients with chronic HTN with the higher target, but this was not associated with improved mortality.

# Steroids
## Sepsis
The **HYPRESS (2016)** trial examined hydrocortisone in 380 patients with severe sepsis without shock. In summary, there was no difference at 14 days for the outcome of septic shock, and no differences in 28d and 90d mortality. Possible 13% reduction in delirium. No excess infections. Slight risk of hyperglycemia.
