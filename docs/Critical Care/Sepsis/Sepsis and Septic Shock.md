### Sepsis
The **HYPRESS (2016)** trial examined hydrocortisone in 380 patients with severe sepsis without shock. In summary, there was no difference at 14 days for the outcome of septic shock, and no differences in 28d and 90d mortality. Possible 13% reduction in delirium. No excess infections. Slight risk of hyperglycemia.

### Septic Shock
