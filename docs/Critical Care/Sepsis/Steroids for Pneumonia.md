# Steroids for Pneumonia


> [!NOTE] SUMMARY
> Multiple SRMAs show a convincing effect of systemic corticosteroids on the need for mechanical ventilation. However, there is no clear effect on mortality.
> Pneumonia is a heterogenous clinical syndrome with varying levels of inflammation, fibrosis, infectious, hydrostatic, immune processes and it is likely that some subgroups would benefit more than others (see COVID/[ARDS](../ARDS/Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md) trials of steroids where mortality benefit is quite convincing).

# Severe CAP
## Siemieniuk et al. 2015
- in adult patients hospitalized for CAP, systemic corticosteroid therapy is associated with a 5% absolute reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation and the rate of [ARDS](../ARDS/Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md)
- possible reduction in mortality (driven by severe pneumonia groups)

## Meduri et al. 2022 (ESCAPe)
- This RCT examines methylprednisolone for severe pneumonia (CAP/HCAP) patients admitted or the ICU or stepdown unit.
- Negative trial with regards to mortality at 60 days
- underpowered, underrecruited, and lower risk than estimated
- NOT able to say that steroids reduce mortality in this context. However, further trials are needed

# Mild to Moderate CAP
- There is no evidence that corticosteroids reduce mortality rates in patients with mild to moderate CAP.
- People with CAP treated with corticosteroids had lower clinical failure rates (death, worsening of imaging studies, or no clinical improvement), shorter time to cure, a shorter hospital stay, and fewer complications

# Adverse Effects
Hyperglycemia risk is increased (4% more requiring treatment).
