Flumazenil can be used in 0.2 mg doses q1min for a maximum of 1 mg in cases of benzo-induced coma. If the patient responds to flumazenil but has recurrent sedation, then flumazenil 1 mg can be given every 20 minutes with a maximum of 3 mg/h.

The use of flumazenil should be restricted to select low-risk cases due to the risk of benzo-withdrawal seizures.
