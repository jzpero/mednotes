# Acetaminophen Overdose/Toxicity
-   Acetaminophen is the most common OTC analgesic and one of the most ocmmon toxic exposures
-   Usually from intentional overdose (50%)
-   Often accidently ingested as part of other medications, especially mixed opioid-acetaminophen combinations like Tylenol \#1-3's
    -   Chronic pain patients
    -   Cold/flu symptoms and medications
    -   Alcohol-tylenol syndrome 

## Pharmacology (Oral)
-   **Maximum therapeutic dose**
    -   Classically, 4 grams per day for healthy adults, and 2 gram per day for those with chronic liver disease.
-   **Toxic dose**
    -   &gt;10 g or &gt;200 mg/kg as single ingestion or over 24hr period OR
    -   &gt;6 g or &gt;150 mg/kg per 24hr period x 2days
    -   "**massive ingestion**" has variable definitions but might be &gt;500 mg/kg or known ingestion &gt;32 grams
-   **Absorption**
    -   A single ingestion of oral acetaminophen is generally completely absorbed by 4 hours post ingestion.
    -   Absorption is delayed (!) with some medications that delay gut motility
        -   Anticholinergics
        -   Opioids
-   **Kinetics**
    -   100% bioavailable
    -   20% bound to serum proteins
    -   VD = 0.85 L/kg
    -   Elimination half-life 2.5 hours
-   **Metabolism**
    -   Pathways of metabolism:
        -   Glucuronidation (50%)
        -   Sulfation (30%)
        -   CYP (10%)
            -   Acetaminophen --&gt; NAPQI, a toxic metabolite
            -   NAPQI + glutathione --&gt; renal excretion
        -   Direct renal clearance (10%)
-   **Toxicity**
    -   NAPQI via the CYP system is usually detoxified via hepatic glutathione to a metabolite that is renally excreted.
    -   Overdose leads to increased NAPQI generation, depleting intracellular glutathione. When stores of this &lt;30% of normal, NAPQI then binds to other hepatic macromolecules, causing **hepatic necrosis** within 12 hours.
    -   The characteristic pattern is **centrilobular necrosis**

## Clinical Manifestations
Excess NAPQI binds to hepatic macromolecules, causing hepatocellular necrosis and potentially SIRS, MODS, [ARDS](../ARDS/Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md), death. Initial clinical findings are nonspecific and delayed. There are four classic stages of acetaminophen toxicity:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th><strong>Stage</strong></th><th><strong>Timeframe</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>1</td><td>Up to 24 hours</td><td>Asymptomatic in most patients.<br />
Possibly N/V, malaise, anorexia.<br />
<strong>hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis</strong> which correlates with a high 4-hour acetaminophen concentration.<br />
<br />
if there is a very severe ingestion (75-100 g) then patients might develop coma or severe lactic acidosis even on the first day, <u>secondary to metabolic decoupling and not necessarily from hepatic damage</u>.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>2</td><td>2-3 days</td><td>Improved Stage 1 symptoms.<br />
<strong>clinical signs of hepatotoxicity:</strong><br />
- RUQ pain and tenderness<br />
- elevated aminotransferases<br />
- hypoglycemia<br />
- metabolic acidosis<br />
- elevated INR</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>3</td><td>3-4 days</td><td>Progression to <strong>fulminant/peak hepatic failure</strong><br />
- metabolic acidosis (lactic due to acute overdose)<br />
- coagulopathy<br />
- renal failure<br />
- encephalopathy<br />
- recurrent GI symptoms</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>4</td><td>2 weeks</td><td><strong>DEATH or slow recovery</strong> taking 1-3 months in survivors. Generally the recovery of hepatic function is quite remarkable if no transplantation is needed.</td></tr></tbody></table>
-   Chronic HAGMA can develop from 5-oxoproline accumulation independent of acute hepatic damage.
-   Peak liver damage is about days 2-3. Peak renal failure is about 1 week.


## Diagnostic Studies
-   **Serum acetaminophen level**
    -   Measure at 4 hours unless previous level undetectable
    -   If 4-hour level borderline or there is suspected delayed absorption, repeat at 8 hours as well.
-   **Serum aminotransferases**
-   Renal function
-   Bilirubin
-   Lactate
-   INR
-   Phosphate level
-   ABG

Current Ontario Poison Centre recommendations are:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Initial presentation</th><th><ul class="incremental"><li><blockquote><p>4 hour acetaminophen level</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>ASA level</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Blood gases</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Electrolytes</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Glucose</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>BUN, Creatinine, osmolality</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>AST, ALT, INR</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Ethanol level</p></blockquote></li></ul></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Sustained-release or concurrent opioid/anticholinergics (extends the absorption dynamics)</td><td>Repeat acetaminophen level q4h until peak, and then q12h until undetectable.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>Those receiving NAC</td><td>Repeat VBG, lytes, glucose, BUN, Cr, AST, ALT, INT q12h.<br />

## Treatment
1.  **GI decontamination**

    -   **Consider early <u>activated charcoal (1 g/kg)</u> through PO or NG routes if possible within 1-2 hours. If extended-release formulation acetaminophen or massive ingestion, can give this past 2 hours. Consider even up to 4 hours. Do not give if sedated unless ETT in situ.**

    -   **Consider <u>gastric lavage</u> if presenting within 1 hour of massive ingestion**

1.  **N-acetylcysteine \[NAC\]** (the antidote)

    -   NAC is nearly 100% effective in prevention of hepatotoxicity if given within 8 hours of acute ingestion

    -   **Mechanism**

        -   \(1\) acutely, prevents NAPQI toxicity via glutathione repletion or via direct reduction back to acetaminophen

        -   \(2\) afterwards, decreases hepatic necrosis via antioxidant effects, antineutrophil effect, increased tissue oxygen delivery

    -   **Route**

        -   IV administration is preferred over PO route esp in Canada.

    -   **Indication** is depending on the nomogram and timeframe:

        -   No further acetaminophen serum measurements are necessary once the need for acetylcysteine therapy has been determined until the completion of the course of therapy.

        -   **Massive ingestion** (&gt;150 mg/kg or &gt;7.5 grams total) with results &gt; 8 hours

        -   **&lt;4 hours**

            -   If result within 8 hours, then wait on that and treat as indicated

            -   If result not within 8 hours, give first dose and wait on results.

        -   **4-24 hours**

            -   Same as above. Empirically give NAC if cannot get results before 8 hours. Modify approach after results back.

        -   **&gt;24 hours or unknown**

            -   Draw labs ?levels and ?liver failure

            -   Start NAC empirically ASAP

            -   If acetaminophen is detectable, or ANY aminotransferases elevated, then treat with NAC.

            -   Don't need to continue NAC if these are all normal.

-   **Risks**

    -   **Anaphylactoid reaction**. Risk factors are lower acetaminophen level, asthmatics. Treat with diphenhydramine, epinephrine, steroids, or stopping NAC. They will usually tolerate PO NAC if IV has too many problems.

    -   **Nausea/vomiting** in 15%.

-   **Regimen**

    -   Standard protocol is 20-hour protocol:

        -   Loading dose of 150 mg/kg over 15 minutes to 1 hour, then

        -   First maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, then

        -   Second maintenance dose of 100 mg/kg over 16 hours

-   **When to stop?**

    -   Acetaminophen level is nondetectable (&lt;66 umol/L), and

    -   AST and ALT are &lt; 100, or decreasing and &lt;50% of peak, and

    -   INR &lt; 2.0, and

    -   Patient is well, and

    -   Minimum of 12 hours of NAC including the loading dose has been given.

3.  **Hemodialysis**

    -   **Because NAC is so effective, if it is available then HD is generally not needed at all.**

    -   There are no established criteria for this, and it is not routinely used. Discuss closely with toxicology/nephrology.

    -   Consider in these situations:

        -   Severe overdose (acetaminophen level &gt;5.3 mm with coma and lactic metabolic acidosis)

    -   **Requires a higher rate (2x) of NAC infusion**

4.  **Liver transplantation**

    -   **Qualification based on the King's College criteria for acetaminophen-induced liver injury**

        -   **Arterial blood pH &lt;7.3, or arterial lactate &gt;3.0 mmol/L after adequate fluid resuscitation; OR**

        -   **All of the following within a 24-hour period: grade 3 or 4 encephalopathy, INR &gt;6.5, serum creatinine &gt;3.4 mg/dL (301 micromol/L).**

 

## Outcomes

-   The outcome is excellent if NAC is given in the appropriate timeframe (&lt;8 to 10 hours), with mortality &lt;1%.

-   Therefore, fulminant hepatic failure and death generally result from delay in seeking medical attention, missed diagnosis, and delayed treatment.
