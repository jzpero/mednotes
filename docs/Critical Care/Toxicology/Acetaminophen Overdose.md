# Acetaminophen Overdose/Toxicity

## Background
Acetaminophen is the most common OTC analgesic and one of the most common toxic exposures. Usually from intentional overdose (50%). Often accidently ingested as part of other medications, especially mixed opioid-acetaminophen combinations like Tylenol \#1-3s.

| Property                 | Characteristic                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Maximum therapeutic dose | 4 grams daily in healthy adults; 2 grams daily in those with chronic liver disease                                                                                                      |
| Toxic dose ingestion     | 10 grams or 200 mg/kg as a single ingestion or in one day; 6 g or 150 mg/kg for at least two days                                                                                       |
| "massive ingestion"      | \>32 grams or \> 500 mg/kg                                                                                                                                                              |
| Absorption               | completely absorbed in 4 hours, delayed by multiple ingestions or anticholinergics, opioids, etc.                                                                                       |
| Pharmacokinetics         | 100% bioavailable, 20% bound to serum proteins, elimination half-life is 2.5 hours                                                                                                      |
| Metabolism               | Glucoronidation (50%), sulfation (30%), CYP (10%) which produces NAPQI which is the toxic metabolite (which is reduced with glutathione to form a renally excreted inactive metabolite) |
| Toxicity MOA             | Increased NAPQI generation  depletes intracellular glutathione and then NAPQI overload leads to binding to hepatic macromolecules, causing centrilobular necrosis                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Clinical Manifestations
Progression to [Acute Liver Failure](../../Gastroenterology/Acute%20Liver%20Failure.md) occurs in less than 1% of presentations in the Wester world.

Excess NAPQI binds to hepatic macromolecules, causing hepatocellular necrosis and potentially SIRS, MODS, [ARDS](../ARDS/Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md), death. Initial clinical findings are nonspecific and delayed. There are four classic stages of acetaminophen toxicity:

1. **Stage 1 (<24 hours)**
	- Mostly asymptomatic, can present with N/V, malaise, anorexia.
	- If the patient develops hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis this corresponds to an initial high APAP level.
	- In very severe ingestions (>75-100 g) the patient can become comatose or have a severe lactic acidosis secondary to metabolic decoupling of the electron transport chain.
1. **Stage 2 (2-3 days)**
	- In this stage, clinical signs of hepatotoxicity develop:
		- Hepatocellular damage and hepatitis (RUQ pain, elevated aminotransferases)
		- Synthetic dysfunction (hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, elevated INR)
1. **Stage 3 (3-4 days)**
	- Marked by a progression to fulminant hepatic failure:
		- severe lactic acidosis
		- coagulopathy
		- renal failure
		- encephalopathy
		- gastrointestinal symptoms
1. **Stage 4 (2 weeks)**
	1. Either progresses to death, or slow recovery phase which takes 1-3 months in survivors. If no transplantation is required then recovery of hepatic function is usually near-complete.

## Investigations
- Initial investigations:
	- serum APAP (4 hours, 8 hours), liver enzymes and synthetic function, electrolytes, extended electrolytes, blood gas, renal panel
	- ASA, serum osmolality, ethanol
- Repeat labs q4H until APAP peaks if not on NAC regimen;
- Repeat the important labs q12H until stopping criteria if already on NAC regimen.

## Treatment
1.  **GI decontamination**

    -   **Consider early <u>activated charcoal (1 g/kg)</u> through PO or NG routes if possible within 1-2 hours. If extended-release formulation acetaminophen or massive ingestion, can give this past 2 hours. Consider even up to 4 hours. Do not give if sedated unless ETT in situ.**

    -   **Consider <u>gastric lavage</u> if presenting within 1 hour of massive ingestion**

1.  **N-acetylcysteine \[NAC\]** (the antidote)

    -   NAC is nearly 100% effective in prevention of hepatotoxicity if given within 8 hours of acute ingestion

    -   **Mechanism**

        -   \(1\) acutely, prevents NAPQI toxicity via glutathione repletion or via direct reduction back to acetaminophen

        -   \(2\) afterwards, decreases hepatic necrosis via antioxidant effects, antineutrophil effect, increased tissue oxygen delivery

    -   **Route**

        -   IV administration is preferred over PO route esp in Canada.

    -   **Indication** is depending on the nomogram and timeframe:

        -   No further acetaminophen serum measurements are necessary once the need for acetylcysteine therapy has been determined until the completion of the course of therapy.

        -   **Massive ingestion** (&gt;150 mg/kg or &gt;7.5 grams total) with results &gt; 8 hours

        -   **&lt;4 hours**

            -   If result within 8 hours, then wait on that and treat as indicated

            -   If result not within 8 hours, give first dose and wait on results.

        -   **4-24 hours**

            -   Same as above. Empirically give NAC if cannot get results before 8 hours. Modify approach after results back.

        -   **&gt;24 hours or unknown**

            -   Draw labs ?levels and ?liver failure

            -   Start NAC empirically ASAP

            -   If acetaminophen is detectable, or ANY aminotransferases elevated, then treat with NAC.

            -   Don't need to continue NAC if these are all normal.

-   **Risks**

    -   **Anaphylactoid reaction**. Risk factors are lower acetaminophen level, asthmatics. Treat with diphenhydramine, epinephrine, steroids, or stopping NAC. They will usually tolerate PO NAC if IV has too many problems.

    -   **Nausea/vomiting** in 15%.

-   **Regimen**

    -   Standard protocol is 20-hour protocol:

        -   Loading dose of 150 mg/kg over 15 minutes to 1 hour, then

        -   First maintenance dose of 50 mg/kg over 4 hours, then

        -   Second maintenance dose of 100 mg/kg over 16 hours

-   **When to stop?**

    -   Acetaminophen level is nondetectable (&lt;66 umol/L), and

    -   AST and ALT are &lt; 100, or decreasing and &lt;50% of peak, and

    -   INR &lt; 2.0, and

    -   Patient is well, and

    -   Minimum of 12 hours of NAC including the loading dose has been given.

3.  **Hemodialysis**

    -   **Because NAC is so effective, if it is available then HD is generally not needed at all.**

    -   There are no established criteria for this, and it is not routinely used. Discuss closely with toxicology/nephrology.

    -   Consider in these situations:

        -   Severe overdose (acetaminophen level &gt;5.3 mm with coma and lactic metabolic acidosis)

    -   **Requires a higher rate (2x) of NAC infusion**

4.  **Liver transplantation**

    -   **Qualification based on the King's College criteria for acetaminophen-induced liver injury**

        -   **Arterial blood pH &lt;7.3, or arterial lactate &gt;3.0 mmol/L after adequate fluid resuscitation; OR**

        -   **All of the following within a 24-hour period: grade 3 or 4 encephalopathy, INR &gt;6.5, serum creatinine &gt;3.4 mg/dL (301 micromol/L).**

 

## Outcomes

-   The outcome is excellent if NAC is given in the appropriate timeframe (&lt;8 to 10 hours), with mortality &lt;1%.

-   Therefore, fulminant hepatic failure and death generally result from delay in seeking medical attention, missed diagnosis, and delayed treatment.
