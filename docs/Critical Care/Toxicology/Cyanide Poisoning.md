# Cyanide Poisoning
## Background
- MOA: **inhibition of cytochrome oxidase a3 in the mitochondria**, leading to disruption of the electron transport chain and aerobic metabolism
- Via **ingestion or inhalation**, absorbed readily and quick onset of action
	- inhalation exposure is common in house fires - burning vinyl produces aerosilized cyanide
	- common co-exposure with CO
	- prolonger nitroprusside infusions
- **clinical signs of hypoxia** despite normal oxyhemoglobin concentration and pulmonary oxygen diffusion:
	- headache/anxiety
	- nausea/vomiting
	- metallic/bitter almond taste and odor
	- coma/seizures
	- liver/kidney failure
	- ischemic pain
	- rhabdomyolysis
	- death
- a **normal lactate essentially rules out this diagnosis**!

## Management
- early recognition of cyanide toxicity
- elimination of ongoing exposure (contaminated clothing, etc) --> probably should call Ontario Poison Control as well, and gather effective collateral if possible
- neutralization or competitive binding of cyanide to target mitochondrial dysfunction:
	- **hydroxycobalamin** avidly binds cyanide to produce cyanocobalamin (soluble, nontoxic, and excreted easily). Dose is 5 grams for adults. This is the *preferred treatment*.
	- **induction of methemoglobinemia** with nitrites (avoid in coHb toxicity)
	- **sodium thiosulfate** which donates sulfur to cyanide to produce thiocyanate (harmless)
