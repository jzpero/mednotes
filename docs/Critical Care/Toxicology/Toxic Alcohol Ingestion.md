# Toxic Alcohol Ingestion
## Summary Table
|         | Ethylene Glycol                                             | Methanol                                                                  | Isopropyl Alcohol                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Source               | Antifreeze, wiper fluids, fuels                             | moonshine                                                                 |                                  |
| Signs and symptoms   | Decreased LOC, hematuria, flank pain, oliguria, hypocalcemia | Decreased LOC, retinal injury and blindness                               |                                  |
| Physical examination | CN palsies                                                  | Afferent pupillary defect, mydriasis, retinal sheen, optic disc hyperemia |                                  |
| Labs                 | High AG and OG, hypocalcemia and long QTc                   | High AG and OG                                                            | High OG, **normal AG**, ketoacidosis | 

## Osmolar gap
$$\textrm{Osmolar gap} = Serum_{osm} - Calc_{osm}$$
$$Calc_{osm} = (2 \times Na) + Glucose + BUN + (1.25 \times EtOH)$$
**Lack of osmolar gap does not rule out toxic alcohol ingestion.** This is due to the conversion of parent alcohol over time to anions:

## Differential by AG and OG

|           | **High OG**                                                                                              | **Normal OG**                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **High AG**   | Ethylene glycol, Methanol, ketoacidosis, propylene glycol, ESRD                                      | MUDPILES, late toxic alcohol presentation |
| **Normal AG** | Isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, severe hyperproteinemia/hyperlipidemia, early toxic alcohol presentation |  n/a                                         |

# Treatment of Toxic Alcohols
In general: ABCs, IV, O2, Foley, monitored setting. Consider:

- **Decontamination**: generally no role, can try NG aspiration if within 60 minutes
- **Enhanced elimination**: treat acidemia as this increases tissue penetration.
	- NaHCO3 1-2 mEq/kg then infusion at 150-250 cc/hr. Goal pH = 7.35
	- Hemodialysis is the definitive therapy and will clear the alcohol and its toxic metabolite. Indications for HD: HAGMA + evidence of end-organ damage
- **Specific antidote**: inhibition of AlcDH which prevents degradation of parent alcohol into toxic metabolites. Options are fomepizole or EtOH.
	- Indications:
		- serum methanol > 6.2 mM or ethylene glycol >3.2 mM, OR
		- documented recent history of toxic amounts of methanol or ethylene glycol, and OG > 10, OR
		- Suspicion of ingestion and 2 of the following:
			- pH < 7.3 OR bicarb <20 OR OG > 10 OR urine oxalate crystals

Isopropyl alcohol: supportive treatment only. Metabolized to acetone (as is acetacetate). Mainly manifests as gastrointestinal and neurologic effects.
