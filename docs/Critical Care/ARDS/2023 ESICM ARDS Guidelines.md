**Scope:** applies not just to the Berlin definition of [ARDS](Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md), but also to Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF) often seen in severe sepsis, pancreatitis, etc which is phenotypically similar but lacks the positive PEEP requirement in Berlin definition ARDS.

# Definition of ARDS
| Criterion                               | Notes                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Imaging - bilateral pulmonary opacities | perhaps allowing CT/US diagnosis?                                                     |
| Minimum timeframe                       | must be present after time period (not specified) of initial stabilization            |
| P/F ratio                               | Consider using S/F ratio (uncertain accuracy particularly in darker skinner patients) |
| Intubation/PEEP                         | Consider including patients on HFNC/NIV                                                                                      |

# HFNC
1. Strongly recommended in non-intubated patients with AHRF not due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema or AECOPD in order to reduce intubation rates.
2. Unclear effect on mortality however - therefore no recommendations for this benefit.
3. No clear recommendation with regards to HFNC vs NIV for non-COPD or cardiogenic pulmonary edema. NIV may reduce the risk of intubation slightly.

# CPAP/NIV
1. CPAP/NIV does not clearly reduce intubation or mortality when compared to conventional O2 therapy  for non-COPD/ADHF presentations
2. CPAP recommended over COT for risk of intubation in COVID-19, but may not decrease mortality
3. Helmet CPAP/NIV - not enough evidence yet

# Low tidal Volume Ventilation
1. Low tidal volume ventulation (4-8 mL/kg PBW) recommended over larger Vt the reduce mortality in ARDS
2. Pplat < 30

# PEEP and LRM
1. Routine PEEP/FiO2 titration using a higher strategy compared to a lower strategy: no recommendation due to high level of evidence of no effect
2. PEEP/FiO2 table vs mechanics-titrated strategy (transpulmonary pressure): high level of evidence of no effect
3. Prolonged LRM: recommended against due to moderate level of evidence against
4. Brief LRM (less than 1 minute): suggested against. High level of evidence of no effeect

# Prone Positioning
1. Recommended for moderate to severe ARDS (PF < 150 and PEEP > 5). High level of evidence in favour of mortality.
2. Start early after intubation, after a period of initial stabilization and titration. Prolonged sessions (16+ hours) should be the target as well.
3. Awake proning is suggested for nonintubated patients with COVID-19 related AHRF

# [Neuromuscular Blockade](../Procedures/Neuromuscular%20Blockade.md)
1. Routine use of continuous infusion NMB is recommended against in moderate to severe ARDS
