# ECLS for ARDS/Acute Respiratory Failure
There is a subset of patients for whom conservative medical management is not enough to support the patient in severe [ARDS](Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md). ECMO/ECLS can partially or fully bypass the lungs to support gas exchange and facilitate lung-protective ventilation. Interestingly, ECLS may promote "ultra-lung-protective" ventilation by mitigating VILI and facilitating even further reductions in mechanical ventilation intensity.

# ECLS Background
See [[ECLS]]. Essentially, can be either ECMO or ECCO2-R. ECMO can be wither venovenous (VV-ECMO) or veno-arterial (VA-ECMO) if cardiac support is required.
- oxygenation is blood flow rate dependent
- CO2 clearance is gas flow rate dependent (i.e. "sweep flow")

## ECMO Centres
- centres with >30 cases per year have lower mortality than lower-volume (<6 cases yearly)

## Major Complications of ECMO
- bleeding (major cause of M&M)
	- most common sites: cannulation site, GI, lung, CNS
	- 23% rate of bleeding complications in VV ECMO
- thrombosis
	- occurs in 25% of patients
- mechanical complications of the cannular or circuit
	- includes cannulation site bleeding, vascular injury, DVT, limb ischemia, air embolism, circuit failure from clot accumulation on the membrane lung
- Neurologic complications occur in 10% of patients - ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke are the most common

# Clinical Use for ARDS
- NO role for routine ECCO2R in ARDS
- VV-ECMO has now shifted from being reserved for patients as a salvage therapy to prevent death from refractory gas exchange to and early adjunct to lung-protective ventilation in patients with severe ARDS when conventional evidence-based strategies (fluid balance, proning, neuromuscular blockade, steroids) are failing
	- due to costs/risks, ECMO has to be selected well for the right patient. 
	- Poorer outcomes are associated with older age, immunocompromised status, number of failing organs, duration of pre-ECMO IMV, and severity of impairment in lung compliance
	- *paucity of long-term data* in patients receiving ECMO
		- CESAR: 6-month QOL same or better compared to CMV

# Evidence - VV-ECMO
The **CESAR (2009)** trial was a landmark trial that looked at the application of modern VV-ECMO in patients with severe and potentially reversible respiratory failure refractory to conventional management.

- Intervention: transfer to ECMO centre for ECMO consideration
- Control: management of respiratory failure without ECMO
- Results: 63% survival without death or severe disability at 6 months vs 47%
	- only 75% of those transferred received ECMO (bias towards null)
	- NNT 6 for primary outcome
- limitations
	- lack of mandated lung protective ventilation in control group (70% only) compared to intervention group (93%) -- bias towards positive

The **2009 H1N1 pandemic** provided anecdotal observational data that suggested improved survival rates in patients with severe viral-related ARDS.

The **EOLIA (2018)** multicentre trial randomly assigned patients with very severe ARDS to immediate VV-ECMO within 7 days of mechanical ventilation or conventional mechanical ventilation alone.

- Investigators were also encouraged to use NMB and prone positioning *prior* to randomization.
- Very severe ARDS: PF < 50 for 3 hours, PF/80 for 6 hours, or pH  7.25 with PaCO2 > 50 for 6 hours
- Primary outcome: 60-day mortality was lower in the ECMO group but the difference was not statistically significant (35% vs. 46%, p value 0.09)
- Secondary outcome: *death or cross-over to ECMO* occured in 58% (control) vs 35% (intervention), P<0.001
	- cross-over group (28% of control group) had very high mortality, 57%
- Adverse events: similar except for greated transfusions in ECMO group

> [!NOTE] Summary of evidence for VV-ECMO in ARDS
> - Two randomized controlled trials (**CESAR**, **EOLIA**) suggest that for severe ARDS, VV-ECMO may reduce mortality in addition to standard conventional care.
> - Baseline mortality is very high, and NNT is probably ~6-10.

# Evidence for ECCO2R
Traditional ARDSNet-informed lung-protective ventilation (Vt < 4-8 ml/kg PBW and Pplat < 30 cm H2O) may be still injurious in 1/3 of patients with severe ARDS. ECCO2R can lower the intensity of mechanical ventilation by enhancing CO2 removal, lowering mechanical ventilation requirements.

Three RCTs have examined ECCO2R in this setting:
1. Morris et al - no difference for ECCO2R vs CMV in 40 patients with severe ARDS
2. Xtravent-study - ECCO2R + 3 mL/kg Vt vs standard of care --> no difference in 60-day VFD/death outcome
3. Protective Ventilation with Veno-venous Lung Assist in Respiratory Failure (REST) trial - ECCO2R did not improve 90-day mortality and VFD at 28 days, but did increase bleeding and ICH compared to control.
