# Recruitment Maneuvers in ARDS
## Definition
*   Definition is a little vague but best described as "_a recruitment manoeuvre is any technique that **transiently increased alveolar pressure above normal tidal ventilation** (which may have included an increase in any pressure, such as plateau, peak or end-expiratory pressure) and **sustained that pressure beyond the normal time**."_
*   From UpToDate: "_A recruitment maneuver is **the brief application of a high level of continuous positive airway pressure** (CPAP) or PEEP, with the **goal of recruiting non-gas exchanging parts of the lung involved with [ARDS](Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md)** to become involved in gas exchange."_

## Rationale

*   in [ARDS](Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md), there is heterogeneity of lung involvement
*   regions may be collapsed/atelectatic and not participating in gas exchange
*   regions may be re-inflated by application of enough positive transpulmonary pressure
*   if these areas can be kept open, then gas exchange should improve and allow for decreaed FiO2 and oxygen induced toxicity

## Techniques

Varied in the literature, no consensus technique. Types of RMs:

*   sustained inflation
*   Sigh
*   PCV (high PEEP, peak pressures 40-60)
*   variable ventilation

## Literature

*   [Gattinoni 2006 (NEJM)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa052052)
    *   5, 15, and 45 cm H2O PEEP highly correlates with the percentage of lung tissue aerated after application of the pressure
    *   the % of recruitable lung is extremely variable and relates to greater total lung weight, poorer oxygenation, poorer compliance, and higher death rates.
*   [Cochrane review 2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD006667.pub3)
    *   only low-quality evidence supported the use of recruitment manoeuvres
    *   improved ICU mortality (but not hospital mortality)
*   **ART trial 2017**
    *   N=1010. Increased 28-day all-cause mortality associated with recruitment manoeuvres to 50-60 cmH2O for patients with moderate-severe [ARDS](Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md)
*   **PHARLAP trial 2019**
    *   stopped recruitment due to ART results
    *   preliminary data suggested no improvement in patient-centred outcomes

## Summary

There is no evidence to support the routine use of recruitment maneuvers in [ARDS](Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md).

*   can be performed in those with ongoing severe refractory [ARDS](Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md) despite lung-protective ventilation strategies, or those thought to be derecruited after a specific event (bronchoscopy, circuit disconnection, etc)
*   example strategy could be PEEP 35 to 40 cm H2O for 40 seconds
*   unknown optimal frequency
*   can be used as part of **open lung ventilation (OLV)** strategy (may increase mortality in ART study)
    *   Low tidal volume ventilation
    *   recruitment maneuver is performed
    *   subsequent downtitration of applied PEEP to a level higher than typically used for LTTV, using PEEP optimization method
    *   _improves oxygenation, but conflicting data on mortality. Possible harm in the ART trial._

### Advantages

*   easy to perform
*   cheapest method of improving oxygenation (compared to inhaled NO, prostacycline, HFOV, ECMO, prone)
*   range of different techniques in the literature (can be tailored)
*   may improve oxygenation (consistent across studies)
*   they are usually already paralyzed and sedated
*   more effective in the prone position

### Disadvantages

*   no consensus on pressure or time targets
*   not appropriate in all conditions (ex. fragile lung in PJP)
*   complications
    *   **barotrauma**
        *   risk of PTX and worsening PTXs
        *   subQ emphysema, pneumomediastinum
        *   cyclic atelectasis
    *   **worsened oxygenation** (paradoxically)
        *   transient effect only
        *   worsensed shunt fraction
    *   **hemodynamics**
        *   increased RV afterload and decreased RV preload
        *   cytokine shower from the shunt thorugh diseased lung
