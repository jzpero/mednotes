# Tracheostomy
Percutaneous tracheostomy is commonly performed for patients in the ICU. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) uses the insertion of a tracheal cannula by a modified Seldinger approach through the anterior tracheal wall, preferably between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings. This is followed by the insertion of a guidewire, and dilation is performed until the created stoma is large enough for the tracheostomy tube to be placed.

> [!NOTE] Summary
> -   In general, tracheostomy should be delayed until at least 10 days after initiating mechanical ventilation
> - Selected patients eg neurotrauma, [GBS](../../Neurology/Neuromuscular%20Disease/Guillain-Barré%20Syndrome.md), stroke may benefit from early tracheostomy
> - Timing of tracheostomy must be decided on a case-by-case basis

## Benefits compared to endotracheal [intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md)
- improves patient comfort
- decreased need for sedation
- physiologic: improved work of breathing (less dead space and airway resistance)

## Surgical vs percutaneous approach
Both STs and PDTs can be performed safely in critically ill patients with a low incidence of complications. A meta-analysis of 22 studies (1,608 patients) demonstrated no significant difference in rates of mortality, intraoperative hemorrhage, and postoperative bleeding between the two procedures.

PDT, compated to ST, has a lower rate of wound infection, stomatitis, shorter procedural time, and cheaper.

## Timing
**No consensus on the optimal timing of trachostomy** in ICU patients. With no clear superior benefit of early tracheostomy, the clinical decision should consider the patient’s prognosis, ability to wean, comorbidities, and risks associated with prolonged endotracheal [intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md).
- early (<10 days) vs late (10+ days) -- likely no difference in mortality
	- A meta-analysis of 13 trials (2,434 patients) demonstrated that all-cause mortality was not significantly lower in patients with an early (≤7 days of mechanical ventilation) versus late (>7 days) tracheostomy
	- unclear benefit on risk of VAP

### TracMan (JAMA 2013)
- tracheostomy at 1-4 days v >10 days invasive ventilation
- Early tracheostomy associated with: — shorter duration of sedation (6.6 vs 9.3 days in the deferred group) — increased number of procedures and associated complications — *no beneficial effect on overall mortality (139 vs 141 deaths at 30 days, no difference at 2 years either) or ICU/hospital LOS*

### Hosokawa et al. SRMA (Crit Care 2015) 
Their analysis indicated that early (versus late) tracheotomy was associated with a larger number of ventilator-free days, shorter ICU stay, shorter duration of sedation and lower long-term mortality rates.
