# Ventilatory Waveform Analysis and Troubleshooting
## Auto-PEEP
This is present when there is persistent non-zero flow at end-expiration. Suggests obstructive defect. Perform an expiratory hold maneuver to determine the degree of auto-PEEP in addition to the set PEEP, and therefore the *total PEEP*. 

How to address it? Consider lowering the RR (to increase expiratory time), increasing flow (to decrease inspiratory time and therefore increase I:E ratio), bronchodilators, etc. Watch out for hemodynamic instability. In severe cases, disconnect the patient from the ventilatory and allow for thoracic decompression and full ventilation before re-connecting.

## High PIP
Perform an inspiratory hold maneuver to isolate the issue to the airway/tube (high PIP, normal Pplat) or the lung compliance (elevated Pplat).
