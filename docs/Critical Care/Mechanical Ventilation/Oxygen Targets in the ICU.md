| **OXYGEN-ICU (2016)**   | Mechanically ventilated adults, excluding AECOPD and severe ARDS                                         | PaO2 70-100 or SpO2 94-96% | PaO2 < 150 or SpO2 97-100% | 11.6% vs 20.2% ICU mortality (p=0.01)                                                                                    | single centre study, unbalanced groups (favouring intervention arm) |

> [!NOTE] Takeaway
> 1. Overall, the data suggest that for mechnically ventiled patients in the ICU, restrictive oxygenation targets may be beneficial (i.e. SpO2 91-96%) as compared to liberal targets (97%+), and we should use the minimal FiO2 required to achieve this. Hyperoxia may be harmful.
> 2. As well, in patients with [MI](../../Cardiology/Ischemic%20Heart%20Disease/ACS.md) (not necessarily ventilated), avoid oxygen unless hypoxic.
