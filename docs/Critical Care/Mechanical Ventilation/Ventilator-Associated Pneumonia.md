# Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia and Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia

## Microbiology
See below for MRSA/PsA information. In addition, Atypical bacteria (e.g. _Mycoplasma_, _Chlamydiae_, _Legionella_) don't generally cause VAP.Â  Consequently, atypical coverage is generally _not_ utilized. Anaerobic coverage for pulmonary infections is generally indicated _only_ in the context of empyema or lung abscess.

## Diagnosis
### Clinical Picture
- worsening oxygenation and compliance
- chest infiltrates (CXR, CT, POCUS)
- Neutrophilia and left shift, fever, sputum production

### Definitions
- There is no gold standard for the diagnosis of HAP or VAP.
- HAP is defined as a pneumonia not incubating at the time of hospital admission and occurring 48 hours or more after admission.
- VAP is defined as a pneumonia occurring >48 hours after endotracheal intubation.

### Investigations
- sampling methods
	- noninvasive sampling with semiquantitative cultures (endotracheal aspiration) are preferred over invasive sampling (bronchoscopic techniques)
		- This is because bronchoscopy hasn't been shown to affect mortality or length of stay in VAP
		- Bronchoscopy probably warranted to exclude PJP/invasive pulmonary Aspergillosis if these are seriously on the differential (leukopenia, steroids, HIV, other immunosuppression)
		- Cutoffs for diagnostic threshold for VAP if invasive methods are used:
			- Protected specimen brush (PSB) - 10^3 CFU/mL
			- BAL - 10^4 CFU/mL
	- nares swab for MRSA
- biomarkers
	- CRP, PCT, etc are not routinely recommended in the decision to start antibiotic therapy
- blood cultures
	- approximately 15% of patients with VAP are bacteremic
	- at least 25% of positive blood cultures in suspected VAP patients are from a nonpulmonary source
- Repeat imaging 

## Differential
Always thinking about these! Viral pneumonia, [ARDS](../ARDS/Acute%20Respiratory%20Distress%20Syndrome.md), atelectasis, pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism with infarction, interstitial lung disease (e.g. COP, AIP).

## Antimicrobial Therapy
### Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia
- Suspected HAP - treat according to microbiology (taking into account local AMR) rather than empirically.
	- recommend empiric coverage for Staph aureus - MSSA vs MRSA depends on risk factors (Se below)
		- MSSA + broad spectrum coverage: pip-tazo, cefepime, levofloxacin, meropenem
		- MRSA coverage: vancomycin or linezolid
	- recommend empiric GNB/PsA coverage
		- double vs single depends on risk factors (See below for VAP)

### Ventilator-Associated Tracheobronchitis
- Antibiotics are NOT recommended (Weak recommendation, low quality evidence)

### Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia
- empiric treatment is guided by local antibiogram and local known pathogens
- in suspected VAP, recommend covering for *Staph aureus, Pseudomonas, and other GNB in all empiric regimens*
	- MRSA coverage if: risk factors for AMR, >10-20% MRSA prevalence, and unknown MRSA prevalance. Use vancomycin or linezolid. Otherwise MSSA coverage.
		- Empiric MSSA + broad spectrum coverage: pip-tazo, cefepime, levofloxacin, meropenem.
		- a negative nares MRSA PCR essentially means the risk of MRSA VAP is <2% -- consider this a test of exclusion (NOT in guideline)
	- Double Pseudomonal coverage recommended for: risk factors for AMR, >10% resistance to the monotherapy, and unknown resistance prevalence (weak recommendation, low quality) Single Pseudomonal coverage otherwise.
	- Avoid aminoglycosides, colistin if possible

#### Inhaled antibiotic therapy
- If the patient has VAP due to GNB susceptible to only aminoglycosides or polymyxins (colistin, polymyxin B) then recommended to treat with BOTH inhaled and systemic antibiotics
- It is reasonable to consider adjunctive inhaled antibiotic therapy as a treatment of last resort for patients who are not responding to intravenous antibiotics alone, whether the infecting organism is or is not multidrug resistant (MDR).

### Proven MRSA HAP/VAP
Treat with vancomycin or linezolid.

### Proven Pseudomonas HAP/VAP
- Definitive treatment should be guided by resistance testing.
- Aminoglycoside monotherapy is not recommended in any setting.
- If the patient is stable, and the resistance profile is known, then treat with monotherapy with a susceptible agent.
- If the patient is NOT stable (septic shock, high risk of death which is >25%) even if the resistance profile is known, then consider combination therapy (2 antibiotics). Once the septic shock resolves, then step down to monotherapy.

### Proven ESBL HAP/VAP
- Definite treatment should be based on resistance profiles.

### Proven Acinetobacter HAP/VAP
- Reminder: this is a SPICE-HAM (AmpC) bug
- Treat with a carbapenem or amp/sulbactam if susceptible.
- If only sensitive to polymyxins then treat with IV polymyxin (colistin, polymyxin B) + adjunct inhaled colistin (see above)
- Tigecycline is recommended against
- Adjunct rifampicin is not recommended in addition to colistin.

### Proven Carbapenem-resistant pathogens
- Generally treated with IV polymyxin + inhaled colistin

## Duration of Therapy
- VAP: 7 days (as opposed to 8-15 days)
- HAP: 7 days

## De-escalation and Discontinuation
- De-escalate antibiotics when appropriate (combination therapy --> monotherapy, broad spectrum --> targeted)
- PCT levels + clinical criteria to guide discontinuation (PCT not available widely in Canada)
