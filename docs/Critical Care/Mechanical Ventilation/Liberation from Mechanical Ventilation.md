# Liberation for Mechanical Ventilation
## Steps for liberation
1.  Optimize conditions
2.  Assess readiness for extubation/spontaneous breathing trial (SBTs)
3.  Conduct SBT daily with sedation holiday  
4.  Extubate if passes SBT
    1.  to room air
    2.  to NIV

## Conditions need to be optimized
*   respiratory  
    *   FiO2 < 40-50%
    *   PEEP < 5-10 cm (more if obese)
        *   can always extubate to CPAP if concerned about precipitating pulmonary edema
    *   normal PaCO2 or etCO2
    *   patient-triggered mode (e.g. PSV)
*   cardiovascular
    *   stable perfusion
    *   stable heart rate
    *   not on high level [Vasopressors](../../Shock%20and%20Resuscitation/Vasopressors.md)
*   neuro
    *   arousable
    *   ideally following commands (e.g. minimal sedation)
*   renal
    *   no uncontrolled acid-base physiology
*   gastrointestinal
    *   NG feeds off for approx 6 hours or so. Due to risk of aspiration with elective airway procedure.
*   underlying issue is resolved or managed

## Assessment of readiness for extubation/SBT
*   LOC satisfactory, and cooperative. Can they protect their airway?
*   Can lift their head off the pillow, and arms off the bed. Do they have [ICU-AW](../Best%20Practices/ICU-Acquired%20Weakness.md)?
*   Adequate cough with tracheal suctioning.
*   Adequate gag with oropharyngeal suctioning.
*   good tidal volumes with zero pressure support (>10 mL/kg IBW)
*   Can overcome -20 cmH2O pressure trigger (adequate MIP). Can they generate enough negative pressure?
*   Satisfactory audible/measured cuff leak. Presence of cuff leak predicts success. Absence of cuff leak may not predict failed extubation. See below.
*   RSBI
    *   classical RSBI per **[Yang-Tobin study (1991)](https://dx.doi.org/%2010.1056/NEJM199105233242101)**:
        *   T-piece
        *   first minute of SBT
        *   spirometer used
        *   resp rate (f) divided by VT in litres.
    * [Zhang et al 2014](https://journals.lww.com/amjmedsci/Abstract/2014/10000/Comparison_of_Pressure_Support_Ventilation_and.7.aspx) suggest you can use PSV 5/5-7 with a threshold of 75 to predict extubation failure

## Daily Spontaneous Breathing Trials
Essentially, an SBT is the process of taking a still-[intubated](../../Procedures/Intubation.md) patient and then simulating the workload of spontaneous extubated breathing with the tube still in situ. The **Awake and Breathing Controlled trial (ABC)** showed that daily spontaneous awakening trial + SBT (SAT/SBT) resulted in more days breathing without assistance, shorter ICU length of stay, shorter hospital length of stay, and lower mortality than standard of care.

### Assessing SBT Success
*   adequate oxygenation
*   adequate ventilation
*   no signs of severe fatigue which can include the following
    *   accessory muscle use, diaphoresis
    *   high RSBI (Yang-Tobin study) > 105
*   no other obvious complications from SBT (arrhythmia, bradycardia, hypotension, severe hypertension)

### Duration, and T-piece vs PSV?
Classically, the options for performing an SBT were broad. One could choose either PSV (5-8/0-5), T-piece. Duration could be 30-120 minutes.

Evidence for equivocality:

 1.  [Subira et. al (JAMA 2019)](https://jamanetwork-com.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/journals/jama/fullarticle/2735502) randomized 1153 adults at low-risk of re-[intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md) to SBTs with 30 minutes of PSV (8/0 cm H2O) versus 2 hours of T-piece ventilation. 82.3% vs 74% of patients were successfully extubated (remained free of mechanical ventilation 72 hours after first SBT), p=0.001. Re-[intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md) rates were the same, and there were no significant differences in ICU or hospital LOS. Hospital mortality was lower (10.4% vs 14.9% in-hospital, p=0.02)
 2. CCM 2020 meta-analysis of 10 RCTs showed that there was no significant difference in the successful extubation rate or rate of reintubation between the T-piece group and PSV group. The pressure used in these studies varied from 5-18cm H2O and the PEEP varied from 0-8cm H2O, which is highly variable.
 3. [Na et al. (Resp Res 2022)](https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12931-022-01942-w) examined PSV (8/0) vs T-piece and found no association of PSV with a higher rate of successful weaning compared with SBT using T-piece

Evidence for either PSV/shorter duration:

1.  CHEST 2020 analysis showed that PSV (7/0) vs T-piece led to successful extubation in 67% vs 56% (p<0.01) of patients at high risk of re-[intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md)
2. latest American Thoracic Society guidelines for weaning recommend PSV spontaneous breathing trials instead of T-piece with moderate-quality evidence
3. **Thille et al. (TIP-EX RCT in NEJM 2022)** randomized 969 high-extubation risk patients to either PSV 8/0 or T-piece for ~1 hour. There was no significant difference in 4-week VFD, 24-h extubation rate, 7-d extubation rate, reintubation rates.

> [!NOTE] SUMMARY
> With the current evidence, consider using shorter (30 minutes) and less demanding (PSV 8/0) SBTs. This may lead to higher rates of extubation and lower mortality

# Address Potential Cuff Leak

## Extubation to Respiratory Support
After a successful SBT and extubation, 10% to 25% of patients require reintubation, and reintubation is associated with higher mortality.

*   Consider extubating to HFNC for most patients.
*   Patients with COPD, CHF, OSA may benefit from extubation to [Non-Invasive Ventilation > NIV for extubation and ventilator liberation](Non-Invasive%20Ventilation#NIV%20for%20extubation%20and%20ventilator%20liberation)
