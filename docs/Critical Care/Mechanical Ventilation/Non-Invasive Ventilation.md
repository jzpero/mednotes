## NIV Basics
*   CPAP = PEEP only
	*   PEEP contributes towards _oxygenation_ alone
	*   same pressure for inspiration and for expiration (IPAP = EPAP)
*   BiPAP = PEEP + delta = IPAP and EPAP
	*   higher pressure for inspiration and lower baseline pressure (PEEP) for expiration
	*   once again, the PEEP contributes to the oxygenation
	*   the **delta** (IPAP - EPAP) contributes to the ventilation
	*   BiPAP 10/5 provides the same ventilation as 15/10
*   if you need to improve oxygenation, increase the PEEP, e.g. PEEP 5 to 10 or 10/5 to 15/10
*   if you need to improve ventilation, then increase the delta (IPAP - EPAP), e.g. 10/5 to 15/5

## NIV Guidelines for acute respiratory failure
### Recommendations & Evidence
#### Strong Recommendations For NIV
1.  **BiPAP** in COPD-related acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis (pH <= 7.35, PaCO2 > 45 and RR > 20-24) despite standard medical therapy.
	1. No significant decrease in mortality in patients who are not acidotic. Focus should be on optimal medical therapy and titration of oxygen to 88-92%.
	2. Improvement of pH or RR from 7.25-7.35 to normal range is usually seen in the first 1-4 h after NIV initiation, and is a good predictor of sucess. BiPAP reduces dyspnea, need for immediate [intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md), ICU admission, hospital LOS, and improves survival. When compared to first line [intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md), BiPAP has similar mortality but decreases VAP/tracheostomy.
2.  **CPAP/BiPAP** for cardiogenic pulmonary edema (excluding acute MI or cardiogenic shock)
	1. decreases LV afterload, increases RV afterload and decreases RV preload
	2. NIV decreases the need for [intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md), reduces in-hospital mortality

#### Conditional Recommendations For NIV
1.  Immunocompromised patients  
2.  Post-surgical patients (supra-diaphragmatic and abdominal/pelvic surgery)
3.  Palliative cancer/terminal illness patients
4.  Chest trauma patients
5.  Prevention of respiratory failure post-exubation (See below)

### No Recommendations For/Against NIV
1.  acute asthma - Unable to make a recommendation on NIV in ARF due to asthma due to uncertainty of evidence.
2.  influenza and other pandemic viral respiratory illnesses
3.  De novo ARF - Unable to make a recommendation on NIV in de novo ARF due to uncertainty of evidence.

## NIV for extubation and ventilator liberation
### Risk Factors for Extubation Failure
1.  Lung comorbidity
2.  Cardiac comorbidity
3.  Age > 65

*   3/3 has >30% risk of extubation failure
*   2/3 has >20% risk of extubation failure
- **For these above patients, we should be routinely extubating to NIV to decrease risk of respiratory failure. Consider doing this for 1/3 risk factors as well.**

### Guideline Recommendations
1. **Prevention of respiratory failure post-extubation**
	*   conditional recommendation to USE to prevent in high-risk patients and NOT USE in non-high-risk patients
	*   in unselected patients, NIV provides no benefit post-extubation compared with standard oxygen therapy
	*   small studies demonstrate ICU mortality and 90-day mortality benefit when high-risk (Age, pulmonary, cardiac conditions) patients are randomized to NIV vs standard therapy post extubation
2. **Treatment of established respiratory failure post-extubation**
	*   conditional recommendation to NOT use NIV for treatment of established post-extubation respiratory failure
	*   increases ICU mortality, probably by delaying [intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md) when [intubation](../../Procedures/Intubation.md) is actually indicated
3. **Facilitating weaning from invasive ventilation**
	*   conditional recommendation to USE to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure
	*   no recommendations for hypoxemic patients
