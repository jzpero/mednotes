[Intubation of the Neurocritical Care Patient • LITFL](https://litfl.com/intubation-of-the-neurocritical-care-patient/)

# Neuroprotective [Intubation](Intubation.md)
## Rationale
Minimizes the harmful effects of [intubation](Intubation.md) which include:

-   an exaggerated reflex sympathetic response to laryngoscopy
-   hypotension due to induction agents
-   exacerbation of raised intracranial pressure

## Indications
- unsecured SAH
- TBI
- Stroke/[ICH](../Neuro%20Critical%20Care/Intracranial%20Hemorrhage.md)

## Contraindications
- crashing patients who need emergency RSI

# Procedure
## Pre-[intubation](Intubation.md) optimization
- ensure adequate preoxygenation and use apnoeic oxygenation
- attach ETCO2 to the BVM device; target an ETCO2 that correlates to a PaCO2 of 35-40 mmHg
- control hypertension prior to [intubation](Intubation.md) using a rapid acting, titratable antihypertensive agent
- consider treatment for intracranial hypertension (if TBI)
	- osmotherapy for raised [ICP](../Neuro%20Critical%20Care/Elevated%20ICP.md)
	- analgesia
	- head in neutral position and avoid JV constrictions

## Prevent reflex sympathetic response to [intubation](Intubation.md)
- first pass success
	- best intubator
	- ear to sternal notch positioning
	- head up 30-45 degrees
- gentle video laryngoscopy
- pharmacologic:
	- **fentanyl 3-5 mcg/kg** (i.e. 150+ mcg)
	- remifentanil 1-3 mcg/kg
	- topical lidocaine

## Induction and [neuromuscular blockade](Neuromuscular%20Blockade.md)
- induction agent
	- propofol or thiopentone
	    -   must decrease dose to avoid hypotension
	    -   increases cerebral metabolic rate (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow
	-   ketamine
	    -   no longer considered contra-indicated in most patients with raised [ICP](../Neuro%20Critical%20Care/Elevated%20ICP.md)
	    -   indirect sympathetic effects may increase blood pressure
	    -   increases cerebral metabolic rate (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow
	-   etomidate is not available in Australia
- [NMB](Neuromuscular%20Blockade.md)
	- rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg IV is the agent of choice; rapid onset, does not increase [ICP](../Neuro%20Critical%20Care/Elevated%20ICP.md)

## Post-[Intubation](Intubation.md)
-   adjust patient’s respiratory rate to target ETCO2 35mmHg until an ABG is obtained to confirm PaCO2 35-40 mmHg
-   target SaO2 95% (avoid hypoxia or extreme hyperoxia)
-   use the minimum PEEP necessary to avoid hypoxia
