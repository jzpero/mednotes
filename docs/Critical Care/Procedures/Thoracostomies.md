# Thoracostomies
Indications generally include:
1. Pleural collections/effusions
2. Pneumothoraces
3. Endocavitary drug administration
4. Traumatic cardiac arrest

## Location
- [Complications of Pleural Procedures > Triangle of Safety](Complications%20of%20Pleural%20Procedures#Triangle%20of%20Safety)

## Materials
1. chest tube kit
	1. Introducer needle
	2. Fascial dilators
	3. Chest tube +/- stiffening dilator
2. sterile setup
3. anesthetic (bupivacaine with epinephrine)
4. pleural evacuation device and suction setup

## Technique
1. If using ultrasound, mark the best site (largest effusion depth).
2. Clean the site.
3. Anesthetize (see below)
	1. skin 
	2. periosteum
	3. deep tissues
	4. pleural space
4. Enter the pleural space with negative pressure on an introducer needle/syringe. Enter just over the top of the rib
5. guidewire insertion
6. Introducer needle out
7. Cut
8. Dilate over guidewire. May have to rotate/pull to break the soft tissues. Aim superiorly for a pneumothorax, and posteriorly for a [pleural effusion](../../Respirology/Pleural%20Diseases/Pleural%20Effusion.md).
9. Pigtail on guidewire. Then advance the pigtail catheter.
10. Guidewire out. Cover to prevent air entry.
11. Connect to pleur-evac or atrium device.

## Secure and Dressing
- Suture
	- mattress or simple interrupted. Avoid purse-string suture.
	- roman sandal wrap
- Vaseline-impregnanted gauze
- Tension bandage over

# Antibiotics
Antibiotic prophylaxis is *conditionally recommended* by EAST guidelines in the setting of tube thoracostomies for penetrating chest trauma.

- Tends to reduce [empyema](../../Respirology/Pleural%20Diseases/Pleural%20Effusion.md); however no clear reduction in pneumonia or mortality.
- Antibiotics tended to be 1st/2nd generation cephalosporins or clindamycin. Regimens highly varied but generally covered with antibiotics until the tube thoracostomy was removed.
- Infections tended to be from skin flora (Staph/Strep)
