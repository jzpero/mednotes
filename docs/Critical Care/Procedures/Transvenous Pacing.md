[EM:RAP Placing a Transvenous Pacemaker - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00-T8PcbStE)
# Steps
1. Single lumen [CVC](Central%20Lines.md) - [Cordis Introducer Sheath](Cordis%20Introducer%20Sheath.md) - 6Fr
	1. Sites: R IJV (preferred) or L subclavian
	2. Remove wire + dilator together
2. Plug the connecting cable (sterile) into the pacing generator (nonsterile) - **venous** connection as default
3. Check the balloon with the syringe - can it inflate? Leave it deflated
4. Feed the wire through the sterile sleeve (make sure the orientation is correct)
5. Thread the wire into the [Cordis](Cordis%20Introducer%20Sheath.md) - let the curve follow to the heart. Go until **20 cm** mark (2 black lines) which indicates that the tip/balloon are just outside of the [Cordis](Cordis%20Introducer%20Sheath.md) sheath
6. Connect the adapter pins to pacing wire
7. Connect the adapter pins to connector cable (negative to negative, positive to positive)
8. **ASSISTANT:** turn on the pacing generator and set up (80 BPM, >5 mA venous. Default sensitivity = 3)
9. Insert the wire to 30 cm
10. Inflate the balloon 
11. Slowly advance the floating wire about 5 cm more - watch the monitor for "injury pattern" which confirms you are in the RV. Or, check using POCUS (need an assistant_)

	2. Check for mechanical capture - pulse or pulse ox
12. Adjust the pacing generator - turn down sensitivity until we lose capture, then turn it up a bit again.
13. Deflate the balloon and lock its stopcock in place
14. Pull the sterile sleeve over to the [Cordis](Cordis%20Introducer%20Sheath.md) and connect it into place
15. Open the sterile sleeve up and lock it on the pacing wire
16. Suture the line. Done!
