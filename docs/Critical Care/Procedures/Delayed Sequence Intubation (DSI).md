Delayed sequence [Intubation](Intubation.md) (DSI) differs from rapid sequence induction/intubation (RSI) in that pre-medication is used to facilitate ventilation/preoxygenation prior to full induction/paralysis. That is, procedural sedation is used to preoxygenate the patient. 

# When is DSI Considered?
1. Cannot preoxygenate the patient by any other means, leading to a high risk of hypoxemia and CV collapse otherwise.
	1. Significant agitation
2. Procedures are required prior to intubation, such as NG tube placement fo stomach evacuation in the setting of GI bleed.

# How to Perform DSI

1. Position the patient head-up at 30-45 degrees
2. Induction agent: **ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV** as a slow IV push over 15-30 seconds to prevent apnea. Additional **0.5 mg/kg doses** to achieve good level of complete dissociation if required.
3. Ensure the airway is patent.
4. Passively oxygenate the patient for at least 3 minutes
	1. Nasal cannula at "flush" rate
	2. NRB, BVM with PEEP valve
5. Administer [Neuromuscular Blockade](Neuromuscular%20Blockade.md) and wait at least 45-60 seconds:
	1. Succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg
	2. Rocuronium 1.2-1.5 mg/kg
6. Intubate the patient


# Evidence for DSI
1. Mostly observational data ([Delayed sequence intubation: a prospective observational study - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25447559/)) showed that preoxygenation was effectively achieved routinely with DSI, and that DSI was not associated with complications.
2. Small N=200 RCT published in 2023 ([Peri-Intubation Hypoxia After Delayed Versus Rapid Sequence Intubation in Critically Injured Patients on Arrival to Trauma Triage: A Randomized Controlled Trial - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37058727/)) looking at DSI vs RSI in trauma patients showed that DSI was associated with lower rate of per-intubation hypoxia, higher first-pass success rate, without incident hemodynamic instability or airway-related adverse events.
