## Post-Partum Hemorrhage
The **WOMAN** trial ([Link](https://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/woman-trial/)) shows that the early administration of TXA decreases mortality due to hemorrhage without increasing the risk of thrombotic events. However, all-cause mortality was not impacted, no differences in the rates of hysterectomy. *Summary: TXA is safe in PPH, but not clearly effective.*

## Non-traumatic ICH
1. **TICH-2 (2018)** studied IV TXA in patients with non-traumatic ICH. There were no differences in mortality, functional outcomes at 3 months, barely any differences in hematoma size.
2. **ULTRA (2021)** studied IV TXA at the initial diagnosis of SAH, and there was no difference in the outcome of good neurologic outcome, nor any of the secondary outcomes.

## Trauma
[**CRASH-2**](http://www.thebottomline.org.uk/summaries/icm/crash-2/)Â demonstrated that TXA reduces all cause death at 4 weeks in trauma patients (Absolute Risk Reduction 1.5%). A subgroup analysis demonstrated a 0.8% ARR reduction in death secondary to bleeding with TXA

## Epistaxis
**NoPAC (2021)** shows that *topical* TXA in addition to topical vasoconstrictor alone, does NOT decrease the need for anterior nasal packing, LOS, recurrent epistaxis, blood transfusion requirement.

## Gastrointestinal Bleeding
HALT-IT
