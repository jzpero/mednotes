| Transfusion Strategies for Acute Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (2013) | Acute upper GIB, stable.                        | restrictive transfusion threshold (Hgb ≥7) was associated with reduced mortality at 45 days compared to a liberal transfusion threshold (Hgb ≥10)          |     |     |     |
| TRISS (2014)                                                            | Septic shock                                    | restrictive transfusion threshold (Hb < 70) was associated with similar mortality but 50% reduction in blood transfusion units compared to Hb 90 threshold |     |     |     |
| REALITY (2021)                                                          | Acute myocardial infarction                     | restrictive transfusion threshold (hemoglobin ≤8) was non-inferior to a liberal threshold (hemoglobin ≤10) for 30 day MACE events                          |     |     |     |
| FOCUS (2011)                                                            | High CV-risk patients post hip fracture surgery | No significant MACE difference between restrictive (Hb < 80) and liberal (Hb < 100) transfusion strategies. However, reduction in units of blood (0 vs 2). |     |     |     |

> [!NOTE] SUMMARY
> For most stable (i.e. not in hemorrhagic shock) patients, consider a hemoglobin transfusion threshold of 70-80.
