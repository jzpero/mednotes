# Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis
## Background
### Outcomes
-   these medications reduce clinically important GI bleeding
-   no clear effect on mortality
-   does not apply to active GI bleeds (different management)
-   **the aim of SUP is to prevent clinically important bleeding:**
    -   1.5 to 8.5% incidence among all ICU patients
    -   up to 15% among patients who do not receive stress ulcer prophylaxis

### Pathophysiology of Stress Ulcers
-   stress ulcers occur in the fundus and body of the stomach, but can also occur in the antrum, duodenum, distal esophagus
-   shallow, oozing from superificial capillary beds
-   generally begins in the proximal stomach soon after serious stressor, but only small % go on to develop voert clinical bleeding
-   due to imbalance between mucosal protection and gastric acid production:
    -   impaired bicarbonate-rich mucosal layer - toxins, bile salts, poor gut perfusion
    -   acid hypersecretion

## Indications for SUP
**Consider SUP in high risk patients** **only** as opposed to all critically ill patients. The following are identified as significant multivariate-adjusted predictors for clinically important bleeding.

1.  **Mechanical ventilation > 48 hours**
2.  **Coagulopathy**
    1.  platelet count < 50
    2.  INR > 1.5
    3.  PTT > 2x control
3.  History of recent GI bleeding
4.  [TBI](../Neuro%20Critical%20Care/Traumatic%20Brain%20Injury.md), traumatic spinal cord injury
5.  Burn injury
6.  Two or more of: sepsis, ICU more than 1 week, occult GIB for 6 or more days, high dose hydrocortisone therapy
7.  NSAIDs or antiplatelets

## Approaches
### Pharmacologic
-   **Oral PPIs** are preferred over **H2RBs** if they can receive enteral medications.  
    -   pantoprazole
-   If not tolerating enteral medications, use an IV H2RB (e.g. famotidine) or IV PPI.
-   **Sucralfate** is a suitable alternative when both PPIs and H2RBs cannot be given.
-   Duration should be until the patient is no longer at increased risk for stress ulceration, particularly upon discharge from the ICU

### Enteral Nutrition
Enteral feeding is an alternative or addition to drugs.
-   improves splanchnic blood flow, improves macroscopic ulceration, stimulates GALT
-   studies inconsistent in showing decreased GI bleeding (low quality)
-   unclear if enteral feeding is sufficient protection in high risk patients

## Risks of Acid Suppression
-   increased nosocomial infections
    -   pneumonia
    -   C. difficile infection (questionable)
-   drug-drug interactions
-   adverse effects of PPIs (interstitial nephritis etc)
