# Management of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome

1. Colonoscopic decompression
2. Initiating [neuromuscular blockade](Procedures/Neuromuscular%20Blockade.md)
3. Percutaneous abdominal catheter drainage
4. Surgical abdominal decompression

The recommendation for the management of a patient with ACS unresponsive to medical treatment is surgical decompression.

Indications for surgical decompression: ACS with new-onset organ failure, an intra-abdominal pressure greater than or equal to 25 mm Hg, and an abdominal perfusion pressure less than 60 mm Hg.
