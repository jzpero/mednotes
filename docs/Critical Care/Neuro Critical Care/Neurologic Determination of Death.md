# Neurologic Determination of Death

## Neurologic Outcomes of Severe Brain Injury
| Outcome                     | Definition                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Brain death                 | irreversible cessation of cerebral and brainstem function                                                                                                    |
| Persistent vegetative state | severe anoxic brain injury progressing to a state of wakefulness without awareness. No purposeful responses, but sleep wake cycles intact                    |
| Minimal conscious state     | Limited interaction with the environment with visual tracking +/- simple commands. Intelligible verbalization or sometimes yes/no but not always appropriate |
| Locked in                   | retained alertness, cognitive abilities, can move eyes and blink voluntarily, but with paralysis of the limbs and oral structures.                           |

## Minimal Clinical Criteria of NDD
Per Shemie CMAJ 2006:

- Two physicians
- Established etiology compatible with NDD
- Absence of confounding factors if correctable:
	- unresuscitated shock
	- core temp <34 deg C
	- severe metabolic disorders
	- [neuromuscular blockade](../Procedures/Neuromuscular%20Blockade.md)
	- peripheral neuropathy or myopathy
	- clinically significant drug intoxications
- Absent brainstem reflexes
	- pupillary response
	- corneal response
	- gag reflex
	- cough reflex
	- oculovestibular (cold caloric)
- Absent movement
	- spontaneous + noxious stimuli (bilaterally and above/below clavicles; excludes spinal reflexes)
- Apnea testing

### Apnea Testing
First address confounding factors.

1. Pre-oxygenate the patient and obtain an ABG (baseline per TGLN should be PaCO2 35-45, pH 7.35 to 0.45). 
1. Disconnect from ventilator
2. Monitor for respiratory efforts
3. Serial ABGs
4. Threshold for completion: **PaCO2 > 60 mmHg and >20 mmHg from pre-apnea baseline and pH < 7.28**

## Nuances of NDD
- Post-cardiac arrest: per CMAJ, at least 24 hours from event (exam answer); per AHA at least 72 hours after normothermia (more typically done).
- Confounding factors
	- may be over-ruled by 2 physicians making the diagnosis
	- therapeutic doses of AEDs are NOT confounding
	- lab recommendations: pH 7.35-7.45, Na 125-129, PO4 > 0.4, glucose 3-20
- Ancillary testing (done if confounding factors are not correctable)
	- Demonstrate there is absent cerebral blood flow: radionuclide angiography, CT angiography, traditional 4-vessel angiography, MR angiography.
	- EEG is not accepted
