# EEG in Critical Care

# Indications for EEG

# Terminology
- "Epileptiform" means "resembling epilepsy" not that the patient is necessarily having a seizure;
- "spike waves" are less than 70ms in duration;
- "sharp waves" are 70-200ms in duration;
- "generalized" means activity in both hemispheres

## International 10-20 system
5x transverse planes, 5x sagittal places. Odd numbers on the left, even numbers on the right, "z" = midline. Fp = frontopolar, F = frontal, C = central, T = temporal, P = parietal, and O = occipital. A "montage" is a specific configuration of electrodes to aid localization.

# Characterizing EEGs
## Rhythms
1. **Alpha rhythm (posterior dominant rhythm)** is a symmetrical 8-12 Hz pattern best seen in the posterior scalp. Increased in amplitude during wakefulness and is more reactive if the patient is alert.
2. **Theta waves** are moderately slow rhythms (4-7 Hz) associated with encephalopathy: ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230511224337.png)
4. **Delta waves** are markedly slow rhythms (<4 Hz) associated with encephalopathy.
	1. **Polymorphic delta activity (PDA)** indicates asymmetric/polymorphic delta waves. Example: ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230511224325.png)

## Reactivity


# Patterns of EEG
## "Normal" EEG
Relative to each individual patient's baseline; however the **typical normal EEG is characterized by an alpha rhythm** with preserved reactivity. *Most patients in the ICU will NOT have this due to critical illness.*

## Slowing
Slowing of the normal alpha rhythm suggests encephalopathy. As the encephalopathy worsens, the EEG becomes increasingly slow (alpha --> theta --> delta).

Diffuse slowing, severe slowing, or PDA occurs in a range of clinical presentations such as hepatic failure, renal failure, sepsis, drug intoxication, hypoxia, head trauma.

Focal slowing is **indicative of an underlying parenchymal lesion** (abscess, hematoma, tumour, ischemia, recovery form focal seizure, etc). For example, focal slowing over left temporal head region: ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230511224705.png)
