# Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH)

# Management
## Airway
- [Intubation](../Procedures/Intubation.md) may be required for airway protection.  However two thirds of patients won't require [intubation](../Procedures/Intubation.md).
- There are no validated or well-defined criteria for [intubation](../Procedures/Intubation.md) – this is a clinical judgement based on examination and trajectory.
- Care is required to avoid stimulation and hypertension, which could worsen intracranial pressure elevation
- See [[Intubation of the Neurocritical Care Patient]]

## BP Management
- 2022 AHA/ASA: In patients with an initial systolic BP of 150-220, acute lowering to **target a systolic BP of 130-150 mm** may be reasonable.  However, lowering the blood pressure below <130 mm is potentially harmful and should be avoided
	- Benefit from antihypertensives is maximized if they are **started** **immediately** (when the risk of hematoma expansion is greatest).
	- The optimal duration of blood pressure control is not known.  Theoretically, benefit would be expected to extend through the period when there is a high risk of hemorrhage expansion (e.g., perhaps the first ~24 hours in patients without coagulopathy).  Gradual transition to oral antihypertensives may be reasonable after >24 hours, among patients who have stabilized

## Seizure Management
- Convulsive seizures occur in ~10% of patients, but the rate of subclinical seizures may be substantially higher
- Risk factors for seizures
	- Cortical involvement (e.g., lobar hemorrhages).
	- Coexistence of subarachnoid and/or subdural hemorrhage.
	- Complications, including rebleeding.
- Indications for continuous EEG:
	- **Impaired consciousness** that is out of proportion to what would be expected based on the CT scan
	- Unexplained fluctuations in mental status
	- Any history or clinical signs of seizure
- Management
	- Seizure **prophylaxis isn't recommended.**
	- Antiepileptic therapy is indicated for a patient with witnessed seizure, electroencephalographic seizure, or nonconvulsive status epilepticus

## Other Supportive Measures
- avoid fever/hyperthermia
- DVT prophylaxis: initially use IPCs, then start low dose LMWH or UFH at 24-48 hours from ICH onset after serial CTs show stability of the hemorrhage
	- Patients with underlying coagulopathy or imaging evidence of ongoing hemorrhage expansion may require a more personalized approach.
- Formal dysphagia screening prior to initiation of oral intake
- sodium management
	- Avoid hyponatremia or _rapid decreases_ in sodium
	- _Routine_ use of hypertonic saline isn't supported by evidence
	- Boluses of hypertonic saline or hypertonic bicarbonate may be used to manage elevated intracranial pressure, ideally as a bridge to more definitive therapy (e.g., an external ventricular drain).
