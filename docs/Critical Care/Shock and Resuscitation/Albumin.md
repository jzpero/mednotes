# Albumin

# Critically Ill Patients
- The **SAFE (NEJM 2004)** study randomized ICU patients requiring IV fluids to albumin or saline.
	- There were no differences in all-cause mortality.
	- Albumin was associated with worse outcomes in patients with TBI
	- There was a non-significant trend towards mortality benefit with albumin use in patients with severe sepsis.

# Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock
- The **ALBIOS (NEJM 2014)** study randomized patients with severe sepsis to 20% albumin + crystalloid solution vs crystalloids alone.
	- Target albumin level was >30 g/L in those in the albumin arm, until ICU discharge or 28 days after randomization
	- Outcomes: in the first 7 days, the albumin arm had a higher MAP  and a lower net fluid balance. No difference in 28-d mortality, 90-d mortality.
	- Those treated with albumin had more favorable SOFA subscores and received fewer vasopressors or inotropes.

# Decompensated Cirrhosis
- The **ATTIRE (NEJM 2021)** trial randomized patients with decompensated cirrhosis with serum albumin < 30 g/L to targeted 20% albumin for up to 14d or standard care.
	- Target albumin level was â‰¥30 g/L
	- There was no difference in the primary outcome of new infection, renal dysfunction, or death between days 3-15 after initiation of treatment.
	- There were more adverse events in the albumin group than in the standard-care group
