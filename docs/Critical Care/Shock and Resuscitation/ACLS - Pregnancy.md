Perform BLS/ACLS as otherwise indicated. Call a CODE OB and get Neonatology /OBGYN/ Anesthesia to the bedside STAT. *The mother is the priority.*

The main differences are as below:

## Maternal Interventions
1. Oxygenate well, avoid excess ventilation
2. IV should be placed above the diaphragm
3. Stop any IV magnesium and give IV calcium chloride or gluconate in this case.
