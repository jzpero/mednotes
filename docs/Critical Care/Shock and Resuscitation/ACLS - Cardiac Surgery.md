# ACLS - Post-Cardiac Surgery
Patients often have unique causes of the arrest related to surgical complications. The incidence of arrest is 0.7-8% following cardiac surgery. Unlike most cardiac arrests – cardiac arrest following cardiac surgery often have better outcomes in terms of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurological outcome.

VF arrest accounts for 25-50% of the cardiac arrests. Cardiac tamponade and other major bleeding account for large portion of other cardiac arrests.

## Algorithm (up until they leave ICU or 10 days post cardiac surgery)
- **shockable rhythm**
	- Perform 3-stacked DC shocks prior to initiation of CPR
- **nonshockable rhythm**
	- PEA
		- If paced, turn off pacing to exclude VF
	- Bradycardia/Asystole
		- Trial pacing (as the native conduction system may be damaged)
- **refractory to above**
	- emergency resternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass are indicated and should be performed ASAP within 5 minutes of cardiac arrest if refractory to defibrillation, CPR, medications, and pacing
	- continue CPR +/- single DC shocks until this happens
	- Once the chest is open internal cardiac massage can be performed by experienced clinicians.

### Adjunct considerations
- Consider heavily tension PTX, tamponade
- avoid full-dose cardiac epinephrine as this can lead to severe hypertension and worsening bleeding if ROSC is achieved, unless a senior clinician instructs otherwise
- IABP - turn to pressure trigger mode to help facilitate CPR. If performing emergency sternotomy then set the IABP to internal mode (rate = 100)\
- FiO2 1.0, turn off PEEP
