# ACLS - Non-Shockable Rhythms
These are (1) PEA arrest and (2) asystole.

## PEA Arrest
Important to differentiate from [ACLS - Pseudo-PEA](ACLS%20-%20Pseudo-PEA.md) as this has different management and prognostic implications (i.e. better, higher chance of detectable ROSC).

## Asystolic Arrest
I.e. "flatline" - no cardiac activity. Very poor prognosis.
