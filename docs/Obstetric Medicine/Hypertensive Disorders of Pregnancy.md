# Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
Spectrum/categories of HDP:

1. **pre-existing HTN** (prior to 20 weeks GA)
2. **GHTN** (after 20 weeks GA)
3. **Transient HTN** (single measurement)
4. **de novo preeclampsia** (new or worsening hypertension with adverse conditions, usually after 20 weeks)

## HTN Definitions in Pregnancy
| Classification         | Definition                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hypertension           | Office measurement ≥140/90, ambulatory measurement ≥135/85 |
| Severe hypertension    | ≥160/110                                                   |
| Resistant hypertension | ≥3 anti-hypertensives                                                           |

## BP Targets in Pregnancy
1. Hypertension Canada: DBP < 85 mmHg
2. **CHIPS (NEJM 2015) trial**: "less tight" (target DBP 100 mm Hg) vs "tight" (target DBP 85 mm Hg) BP control in women with nonproteinuric pre-existing or gestational HTN.
	1. No difference in maternal or fetal outcomes
	2. Higher severe hypertension in the less tight group (40 vs 28%) and had more laboratory features of HELLP

# Preeclampsia
This is a multi system disorder in pregnancy that is mediated by the placenta, that results in systemic vascular and endothelial dysfunction, resulting in maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.

Risk factors: first pregnancy, new partner, IVF, family history, age <20 or >35.
Maternal risk factors: prior pre-eclampsia, chronic HTN, DM, renal disease, autoimmune disorders, [obesity](../Endocrinology/Obesity/Obesity.md).
Fetal risk factors: multiple gestation, hydrops fetalis, molar pregnancy.

## Diagnosis/Definition
1. Hypertension as above.
2. Gestational age > 20 weeks
3. Adverse conditions with end-organ damage or severe complications that warrant delivery and IV MgSO4 (see below)

| System            | Adverse condition                                                                         | Severe Complications                                                                             |

## Prevention of Pre-eclampsia
- **ASA** 81-162 mg daily
	- this was examined in the **ASPREE** trial (NEJM 2017) which randomized women to ASA 150 mg vs placebo, and showed that this intervention reduced pre-eclampsia <37 weeks (1.6% vs 4.3%)
	- *start 12-16 weeks and continue until 36 weeks*
	- Indications per the USPTF: prior pre-eclampsia, chronic HTN, DM1 or DM2, CKD, SLE, APLA, multiple gestation, two or more minor factors (such as nulliparous or new partner, IVF, Age > 35, BMI > 30, first-degree family history of pre-eclampsia)
- **Calcium** 1000 mg daily supplementation recommend ed if low dietary intake (<600 mg)
- **APLA testing**
	- diagnostic criteria
		- obstetric event: 3 pregnancy losses <10 weeks, 1 pregnancy loss > 10 week, 1 preterm pre-eclampsia <34 weeks
		- arterial or venous thrombosis
		- laboratory criteria
	- if obstetric criteria, treat with ASA +/- prophylactic dose LMWH

## Treatment of Pre-eclampsia
### 1 - Hypertension Management
- Note: this doesn't prevent progression of pre-eclampsia.
- See above for BP management in pregnancy.

### 2 - Eclampsia Prevention
- **IV magnesium sulfate** is the medication of choice
	- Informed by the **Magpie (Lancet 2002) trial** which randomized 10,000 women with pre-eclampsia to Mg vs placebo. It showed a 58% RRR NNT 91 reduction in eclampsia, and trend towards decreased mortality.
	- Therefore IV MgSO4 is indicated for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia.
		- Preventative indications: severe pre-eclampsia, severe HTN, headache, vision changes, RUQ plain, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, AKI
		- Treatment indications: first-line for seizures in pregnancy which are related to eclampsia.
	- Regimen: *4g IV loading dose then 1-2 g/hr for at least 24 hours after delivery*. Requires a Foley (everyone) and a monitored setting
	- Toxicity of IV MgSO4:
		- Symptoms: respiratory suppression, bradycardia, hypotension, reduced GCS and CNS suppression
		- Monitoring: decreased tendon reflexes, decreased UOP. NOT by monitoring Mg levels.
		- Treatment: stop Mg, IV calcium gluconate, and consider RRT

### 3 - Delivery
- decision is made by the OB (involve them early!)
- indications for delivery are generally
	- severe pre-eclampsia
	- refractory maternal symptoms (resistant HTN, persistent symptoms, and end-organ damage)
	- fetal complications: IGUR, Doppler abnormalities, fetal distress
	- women at term: >37 weeks GA
- **antenatal corticosteroids for fetus <35 weeks GA** (betamethasone). [Per the ACOG](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/08/antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-fetal-maturation):
	- A single course of corticosteroids is recommended for pregnant women between 24 0/7 weeks and 33 6/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, including for those with ruptured membranes and multiple gestations. It also may be considered for pregnant women starting at 23 0/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, based on a family’s decision regarding resuscitation, irrespective of membrane rupture status and regardless of fetal number
	-   Administration of corticosteroids for pregnant women during the periviable period who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days is linked to a family’s decision regarding resuscitation and should be considered in that context
	-   A single course of betamethasone is recommended for pregnant women between 34 0/7 weeks and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation at risk of preterm birth within 7 days, and who have not received a previous course of antenatal corticosteroids.
	- Regularly scheduled repeat courses or serial courses (more than two) are not currently recommended.
	- A single repeat course of antenatal corticosteroids should be considered in women who are less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days, and whose prior course of antenatal corticosteroids was administered more than 14 days previously. Rescue course corticosteroids could be provided as early as 7 days from the prior dose, if indicated by the clinical scenario.
- pre-eclampsia is not a contraindication for vaginal delivery
- epidurals are safe when Plt > 75 and without coagulopathy

## Post-Partum Care
1. BP tends to rise 3-6 days post-partum
2. Pre-eclampsia puts women at 4x increased risk of chronic HTN, 2x increased risk of heart disease, stroke, VTE, and diabetes. *Make sure to counsel the patient about future pregnancy risk, CVD risk, and to quit smoking, lose weight, and support breastfeeding*
3. ACE inhibitors are safe in breast feeding
