# VTE in Pregnancy
- Pregnancy increases the risk of VTE (highest risk in 3rd trimester and in the first 6 weeks postpartum)
- DVT
	- 80% in the left leg (due to left iliac compression)
	- 60% in the iliofemoral vein. Tends to present with back/buttock/thigh pain as opposed to calf pain.
- PE
	- difficult to clinically diagnose as dyspnea and tachycardia can be normal in pregnancy

## ARTEMIS / Pregnancy-Adapted YEARS Algorithm
This was a study published in NEJM by van der Pol et al. in 2019 that examined a strategy using pregnancy-adapted YEARS in the diagnosis of PE in pregnant women.

Population: Adult women with chest pain or dyspnea presenting to hospital.
Intervention: YEARS criteria (s/s of DVT, hemoptysis, and PE as the most likely Dx), combined with the D-dimer (<500 or <1000).

- Low pretest probability: 0/3 YEARS, D-dimer <1000; effectively excluded PE
- Higher pretest probability: 1+ YEARS, D-dimer <500

Conclusion: in a low PTP setting (low D-dimer and 0 YEARS), CTPE is not required to rule out PE in pregnant women.

This study is polarizing and a single study; not guideline based yet. *Therefore for the RCE, do not follow this study.*

## Imaging Modalities
- Doppler leg ultrasound
	- 91% sensitivity, NPV 99%
	- however, cannot rule out DVT with a single ultrasound
	- need to ensure visualisation of the proximal veins (iliac, femoral) to the popliteal veins
- V/Q vs CTPA
	- **V/Q scan is first-line according to SOGC/Thrombosis Canada/ACCP**
	- V/Q has less radiation for the mother than CTPA (risk of breast cancer), but slightly greater risk of radiation to the fetus (childhood cancer)
- No imaging?
	- For now, D-dimer and clinical pretest probability (Well's/YEARS) is NOT recommended for diagnosis if pregnancy. Pregnant women SHOULD undergo diagnostic imaging.

## Radiation Counselling
- 1 rad = 10 mGy = 10 mSv
- 10 rads is the required dose for teratogenicity or miscarriage
- The acceptable upper limit in pregnancy is **<5 rad**
- Maternal radiation
	- CTPA <0.5 rad
	- VQ 0.007-0.03 rad
	- CXR 0.005 rad

# Management of Acute VTE in Pregnancy
**Duration:** minimum 3 months including 6 weeks post-partum
**Drug:** LMWH or UFH
**Considerations:**

- weight based dosing
- once or twice daily dosing
- Xa level monitoring? (not routinely recommended)
- risk of bleeding and HIT

## Other Treatments
- Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy
	- first trimester: warfarin embropathy (mid-facial and limb hypoplasia and stippledbone)
	- second-third trimesters: neurologic abnl, microcephaly, optic atropy, neonatal haemorrhage
- DOACs are not recommended in pregnant or breastfeeding women
- tPA only for life threatening and hemodynamically unstable
- HIT: fondaparinux, consult hematology
- IVC filter: same indications as outside of pregnancy. Consider use if the VTe is newly diagnosed close to delivery (<2-4 weeks). Needs prompt removal post-partum and hematology consultation.

# Management of VTE Peri-Partum
- **If the woman is on therapeutic AC:**
	- Planned delivery
		- withhold LMWH for 24 hours pre-neuraxial analgesia
		- Admit for UFH if VTE diagnosed <4 weeks of delivery, and hold 6 hours pre-neuraxial analgesia
	- Spontaneous labour --> withhold anticoagulation
- **If the woman is on prophylactic AC:**
	- Withhold LMWH anticoagulation 12 hours pre-neuraxial analgesia
- **Post-partum**
	- restart AC 4 hours post removal of neuraxial anesthesia
	- generally this is 4-6 hours post vaginal delivery, 6-8 hours post CS if hemostasis is achieved

# Anticoagulants and Breast-Feeding
Safe in breastfeeding: LMWH, UFH, fondaparinux/danaparoid, warfarin.
Not safe in breastfeeding: DOAC

*While on anticoagulation, women need to be on contraception (avoid estrogen based contraceptives). This essentially means that they need to consider progestin only pill, Progestin based IUD, or surgical contraception.*


> [!NOTE] Spontaneous labour
> As a rule of thumb, hold anticoagulation for spontaneous labour!
