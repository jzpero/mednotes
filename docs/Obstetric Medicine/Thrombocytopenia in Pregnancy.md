# Thrombocytopenia in Pregnancy
Top three diagnoses:

1) Gestational thrombocytopenia (70-80%)
2) ITP (1-4%)
3) [preeclampsia](Hypertensive%20Disorders%20of%20Pregnancy.md) with HELLP  

What are the platelet targets in pregnancy?

- ITP: Vaginal delivery > 30, CS > 50, neuraxial anesthesia > 80
- HELLP/Pre-eclampsia: All >20, CS > 50, actively hemorrhaging or rapidly progressing coagulopathy --> transfuse all

Consider the following workup:

- CBC, retics, smear, liver function, HIV/HBC/HCV, UA/urine protein to creatinine ration
- TSH, ANA, APLA, H pylori, INR/PTT, DAT

# Gestational Thrombocytopenia
- most common cause of maternal thrombocytopenia
- typically causes drop in T3 (or newly diagnosed)
- typically the platelets > 70 or more commonly > 100
- this is a diagnosis of exclusion, do your full workup
- no treatment required, typically resolves <6 weeks postpartum

# ITP in Pregnancy
- pre-existing thrombocytopenia
- treat when Plt < 30, clinically bleeding, or < 50 near delivery
- Rx: prednisone or IVIG, avoid dexamethasone as this crosses the placenta
- consult pediatrics to rule out neonatal thrombocytopenia (10% of cases)
