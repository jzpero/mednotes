# Hearing Loss

Two major types of hearing loss (HL): sensorineural HL (SNHL) and conductive HL.

## Conductive vs SN HL

### Interpretation
|                  | Weber's                   | Rinne's                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Normal           | Midline                   | Air conduction > bone conduction bilaterally (normal) |
| Conductive HL    | Localizes to side with HL | Bone conduction > air conduction (abnormal)           |
| Sensorineural HL | Localizes to side w/o HL  | Air conduction > bone conduction (normal)                                                      |
