The comprehensive neurologic examination is a head-to-toe interrogation of central, peripheral, neuromuscular junction, and muscular components. The purpose is to localize pathology (level of problem, laterality) and to determine neurologic involvement of organic disease.

Does the problem originate in the brain, spinal cord, nerve root, peripheral nerve, or muscle? And then: which part of the above?

How do you organize the examination? **Start at one end and move to the other.**
