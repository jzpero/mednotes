# Iron deficiency anemia
# Etiology of iron deficiency
- Hemorrhage (most common)
	- Gastrointestinal (NSAIDs etc)
	- Urogenital (hematuria)
	- Respiratory (hemoptysis)
	- Trauma (and surgery)
	- Blood donations
	- Blood loss leading to iron deficiency is almost always clinically inapparent
- Increased iron demand with inadequate supply
	- Adolescence
	- Pregnancy
	- Breastfeeding
	- Increased erythropoiesis in the course of treatment of VB12 deficiency
- GI malabsorption
	- Bariatric surgery
	- H pylori infection
	- Autoimmune gastritis
	- Celiac disease
	- Intestinal resection
	- Low-protein diet
	- High intake of substances that decrease iron absorption
- Low dietary iron
	- Vegetarian/vegan
- Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) a rare AR disorder
- Chronic gastric acid suppression
	- PPI etc

# Clinical Features
- Systemic manifestations of anemia
- Signs and symptoms of chronic iron deficiency
	- Perverted appetite (pica)
	- Pain/tingling and smoothing of the tongue
	- Dry skin
	- Painful cheilosis
	- Nail and hair abnormalities (pale, fragile, longitudinal stripes and furrows; fine, fragile, split ends)
- Underlying condition eg CRC

# Treatment
- Treat the underlying cause
- Iron replacement therapy to restore normal serum ferritin levels
	- No known malabsorption:
		- Oral iron elemental form or fixed combinations or iron and ascorbic acid
		- Avoid long-term gastric acid suppression therapy
		- Should increase reticulocytes within 5-10 days and Hb should slowly increase after 1-2 weeks of therapy
	- Intolerance or refractory to PO iron, treated with an ESA in setting of chemotherapy, malabsorption, IBD, chronic inflammatory disease, CKD:
		- IV iron
		- Iron infusions have risk of severe hypersensitivity reaction
- Pregnant and breastfeeding women should have prophylactic iron, 30 mg/d and 100-200 mg/d if deficient
- PRBC if severe and symptomatic
