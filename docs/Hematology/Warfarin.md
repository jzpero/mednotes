# Acetaminophen interacts with Vitamin K antagonism
[Warfarin and acetaminophen interaction in a 47-year-old woman | CMAJ](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/19/E506)
- Acetaminophen interacts pharmacodynamically with the vitamin K antagonism effect of warfarin, leading to significant and under-recognized potential for supratherapeutic anticoagulation
- Effect can be seen with even 2-4 grams (therapeutic dose) daily. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) looking at mean differences of maximum INR change when comparing acetaminophen (1.3â€“4 g/d) with placebo in patients taking vitamin K antagonists found that **acetaminophen caused a dose-dependent increase in the INR of 0.17 per gram per day, with an average INR increase of 0.62**
- No guidelines for concomitant usage, suggest more frequent INR checks while taking acetaminophen
- Management:
	- stop acetaminophen
	- reverse coagulopathy if required
	- tight monitoring of INR
	- bridge with heparins if required
