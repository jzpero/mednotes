These can raise concern for an underlying hematologic malignancy, but can also be a normal variation or due to another cause. **The basic elements of evaluation include personal history and physical examination; family history; review of medication, supplements, and other drug use; complete blood count and differential; and peripheral blood smear.**
# Lymphopenia and Neutropenia
**Lymphopenia** can occur as a response to steroids, other medications, bacterial, viral infections. Chronic low lymphocytes should prompt consideration of underlying immunodeficiency. 

- Immunodeficiency disorder
- Infections: HIV, TB, hepatitis, typhoid, malaria, measles, fungal
- steroids, RTX, immunosuppressants
- Systemic disease (autoimmune, endocrine)
- Alcohol, zinc deficiency, protein-losing enteropathy

**Neutropenia** can result from impaired marrow production, immune mediated destruction, or cellular redistribution to the spleen (for example in portal hypertension). Severe neutropenia is defined as ANC < 0.5.

- *Benign ethnic neutropenia (Duffy-null neutropenia)* is a mild neutropenia (1-1.5) driven by the absence of the Duffy antigen (receptor for Falciparum ovale) --> hence more common amongst sub-Saharan African or Middle-Eastern patients. Myeloid progenitors are mildly reduced, but maturation and function are normal. It is clinically insignificant w/o increased risk of infections.
- *Medication-induced neutropenia* results from impaired granulopoiesis or an antibody-mediated destructive process. It is usually seen in the first 3 months of drug initiation as is usually reversible. Most often in patients >50 yrs age. Can involve fever, oral ulcerations. Remove the drug, and the patient will get better within 1-3 weeks. G-CSF can be considered to shorten recovery time, and can be used in patients with neutropenia and active infection.
- *Nutritional deficiencies* such as folate, B12 can cause neutropenia along with macrocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Copper deficiency as well.
- *Autoimmune conditions* like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis (e.g. Felty syndrome), etc.
- Other: Sepsis, HIV, EBV, aplastic anemia
# Neutrophilia, Lymphocytosis, and Monocytosis
These are often reactive to infection or general inflammation.

**Lymphocytosis** occurs with many viral processes such as acute EBV. Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis is a premalignant condition (--> CLL) with a monoclonal population of B lymphocytes <5 that does not meet criteria for CLL or other LPD.

**Neutrophilia** can be from cigarette smoking, bacterial infection, medications such as steroids, and obesity (especially in women).

**Monocytosis** can be from infections such as TB, but can represent an underlying hematopoietic stem cell disorder or [CMML](../Malignant%20Hematology/Myeloid%20Leukemias.md) especially with other cytopenias.
