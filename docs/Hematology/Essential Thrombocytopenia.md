# Essential Thrombocytopenia

## Workup
If the platelet count is >1000, then acquired vWF syndrome must be ruled out by measurement of ristocetin cofactor activity.

### Platelet-Lowering Agent
1. Hydroxyurea (first-line)
2. Anagrelide (alternative)

### ASA
ASA is indicated for all but very low-risk disease (for thrombosis). Factors that increase the risk of thrombosis are increased age, JAK2 positive, history of thrombosis.

However, if there is acquired von Willebrand syndrome (as defined by low ristocetin cofactor activity), then hold off on ASA initiation until that is resolved (by cytoreduction).
