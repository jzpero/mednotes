# Echocardiograms in Bloodstream Infections
=========================================

Indicated
---------

1.  Staph aureus

Potentially Indicated
---------------------

**Non-beta-hemolytic streptococcus**

IE is relatively uncommon (8.5%) in bacteremia with NBHS.

**HANDOC** **score**

\- presence of Heart murmur or valve disease; Aetiology with the groups of _Streptococcus mutans_, _Streptococcus bovis_, _Streptococcus sanguinis_, or _Streptococcus anginosus_; Number of positive blood cultures ≥2; Duration of symptoms of 7 days or more; Only 1 species growing in blood cultures; and Community-acquired infection 

Cutoff is 3 points.

\- sensitivity 100%

\- specificity 73-76%

**Enterococcus faecalis**

Enterococcal IE affects 4.29% of all episodes of E-BSI.

**NOVA score**

Number of positive cultures, Origin of infection unknown, Valve disease, and Auscultation of murmur

**DENOVA score**

+Long Duration of symptoms (≥ 7 days) and Embolization

**NOVA (cutoff at ≥ 4)**

sensitivity 100%; specificity 29%

**DENOVA (cutoff at ≥ 3)**

sensitivity 100%; specificity 85%

**Candidemia  
**

Infective endocarditis (IE) should be suspected in non-neutropenic patients with persistently positive blood cultures (with or without physical stigmata of IE), especially in the setting of predisposing conditions such as prior IE or injection drug use (IDU) \[[4](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults/abstract/4)\]. In such cases, echocardiography should be pursued. In one study of 20 patients with _Candida_ IE, 65 percent had a history of IDU and 55 percent had a prior episode of bacterial IE.

Routine echocardiography is not warranted for patients with candidemia in the absence of the above factors, given the rarity of this complication; in one study that included 187 adults with candidemia who underwent routine echocardiography, IE was diagnosed in 5.9 percent of cases
