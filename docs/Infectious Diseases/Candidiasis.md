Candidiasis
===========

Summary (2016 IDSA Guidelines)
------------------------------

### Candidemia in Non-Neutropenic Patients

1.  Initial Therapy
    1.  **Echinocandin** **is recommended as initial therapy** (caspofungin 70 mg loading then 50 mg daily; micafungin 100 mg daily; anidulafungin 200 mg then 100 mg daily).
        1.  Testing for echinocandin susceptibility should be considered in patients who have had prior treatment with an echinocandin and among those who have infection with _C. glabrata_ or _C. parapsilosis_
    2.  **Fluconazole is acceptable alternative** (800 mg loading dose or 12 mg/kg, then 400 mg or 6 mg/kg) daily. For selected patients (not critically ill, low risk of fluconazole resistant Candida)
        1.  Testing for azole susceptibility is recommended for all bloodstream and other clinically relevant _Candida_ isolates.
        2.  Voriconazole 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg (3 mg/kg) twice daily is effective for candidemia, but offers little advantage over fluconazole as initial therapy
    3.  **Lipid formulation amphotericin B (AmB) (3–5 mg/kg daily) is a reasonable alternative** if there is intolerance, limited availability, or resistance to other antifungal agents
2.  Transitioning
    1.  **Transition from echinocandin to fluconazole is recommended** for patients who are clinically stable, have susceptible isolates (e.g. _albicans_, and repeat negative blood cultures after starting antifungal therapy, within 5-7 days usually.
    2.  **Transition from AmB to fluconazole is recommended** after 5–7 days among patients who have isolates that are susceptible to fluconazole, who are clinically stable, and in whom repeat cultures on antifungal therapy are negative
    3.  **For infection due to _C. glabrata_**, transition to higher-dose fluconazole 800 mg (12 mg/kg) daily or voriconazole 200–300 (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily should only be considered among patients with fluconazole-susceptible or voriconazole-susceptible isolate
    4.  **Voriconazole** is recommended as step-down oral therapy for selected cases of candidemia due to _C. krusei_
3.  Duration
    1.  **Follow-up blood cultures should be performed every day or every other day** to establish the time point at which candidemia has been cleared
    2.  Recommended duration of therapy for candidemia **without obvious metastatic complications** is for **2 weeks after documented clearance of _Candida_ species from the bloodstream and resolution of symptoms attributable to** candidemia.
4.  Other
    1.  All nonneutropenic patients with candidemia should have a dilated ophthalmological examination, preferably performed by an ophthalmologist, within the first week after diagnosis

### Candidemia in Neutropenic Patients (Differences only)

1.  **Fluconazole**, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, can be used for step-down therapy during persistent neutropenia in clinically stable patients who have susceptible isolates and documented bloodstream clearanc.
2.  **Voriconazole**, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 doses, then 200–300 mg (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily, can be used in situations in which **additional mold coverage is desired**.
3.  For infections due to _C. krusei_, an echinocandin, lipid formulation AmB, or voriconazole is recommended
4.  Recommended minimum duration of therapy for candidemia without metastatic complications is 2 weeks after documented clearance of _Candida_ from the bloodstream, provided **neutropenia** and symptoms attributable to candidemia have resolve.
5.  Ophthalmological findings of choroidal and vitreal infection are minimal until recovery from neutropenia; therefore, **dilated fundoscopic examinations should be performed within the first week after recovery from neutropenia**
6.  In the neutropenic patient, sources of candidiasis other than a CVC (eg, gastrointestinal tract) predominate
7.  Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)–mobilized granulocyte transfusions can be considered in cases of persistent candidemia with anticipated protracted neutropenia

### Chronic Disseminated (Hepatosplenic) Candidiasis

### Invasive Candidiasis in the ICU

#### Empiric Treatment

#### Prophylaxis

### Intraabdominal Candidiasis

1.  The **choice of antifungal therapy is the same** **as for the treatment of candidemia** or empiric therapy for nonneutropenic patients in the ICU
2.  Treatment of intra-abdominal candidiasis should include source control, with appropriate drainage and/or debridement

### Candidal Intravascular Infections

### Osteoarticular Infections

### CNS Candidiasis

### Urinary Tract Infections

### Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

### Oropharyngeal Candidiasis

*   **mild disease**
    *   clotrimazole troches, 10 mg 5 times daily or miconazole mucoadhesive buccal 50-mg tablet applied to the mucosal surface over the canine fossa once daily for 7–14 days are recommended
    *   nystatin suspension (100 000 U/mL) 4–6 mL 4 times daily, OR 1–2 nystatin pastilles (200 000 U each) 4 times daily, for 7–14 days
*   **moderate to severe disease**
    *   oral fluconazole, 100–200 mg daily, for 7–14 days
*   **fluconazole refractory disease**
    *   itraconazole solution, 200 mg once daily OR posaconazole suspension, 400 mg twice daily for 3 days then 400 mg daily, for up to 28 day
    *   voriconazole, 200 mg twice daily, OR AmB deoxycholate oral suspension, 100 mg/mL 4 times daily
    *   IV echinocandin or IV AmB
*   Chronic suppressive therapy is usually unnecessary. If required for patients who have recurrent infection, fluconazole, 100 mg 3 times weekly, is recommended.
*   For HIV-infected patients, antiretroviral therapy is strongly recommended to reduce the incidence of recurrent infections
*   For denture-related candidiasis, disinfection of the denture, in addition to antifungal therapy is recommended

### Esophageal Candidiasis

*   **Systemic antifungal therapy is always required**. A diagnostic trial of antifungal therapy is appropriate before performing an endoscopic examination
    *   Oral fluconazole, 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily, for 14–21 days is recommended
    *   For patients who cannot tolerate oral therapy, intravenous fluconazole, 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, OR an echinocandin (micafungin, 150 mg daily, caspofungin, 70-mg loading dose, then 50 mg daily, or anidulafungin, 200 mg daily) is recommended
    *   Consider de-escalating to oral therapy with fluconazole 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily once the patient is able to tolerate oral intake
*   For patients who have recurrent esophagitis, chronic suppressive therapy with fluconazole, 100–200 mg 3 times weekly, is recommended
*   For HIV-infected patients, antiretroviral therapy is strongly recommended to reduce the incidence of recurrent infections
