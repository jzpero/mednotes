# Introduction
_Capnocytophaga canimorsus_ is a commensal organism colonized in oral flora of dogs and cats and causes severe sepsis through bite wounds in immunocompromised patients. 

# Microbiology
_Capnocytophaga_ species are slow growing, capnophilic ("carbon loving"), facultative anaerobes. They are long, thin, and generally fusiform gram-negative rods. _C. canimorsus, C. cynodegmi,_ and _C. stomatis_ are found in the oral cavity of dogs and cats, whereas all the other species are found in the human oral cavity.

# Epidemiology
## Risk Factors
- dog and cat owners
- immunocompromised individuals:
	- asplenia
	- cirrhosis
	- alcoholism
	- renal failure/dialysis

# Clinical Presentation
- **Septic shock**
	- classical severe presentation is septic shock with fever, DIC, purpura, hypotension, AKI, AMS
	- most associated with immunocompromised status
	- In approximately half of cases, there is a history of dog bite or other contact with dog saliva and occasionally a history of cat scratch or contact with cat saliva
	- delay between dog bite and clinical presentation ranges from 1 to 30 days, with an average of 5 to 6 days
- **Other presentations**
	- Sepsis
	- FUO
	- Cellulitis
	- Meningitis
	- Respiratory tract infection/pneumonia
	- Periodontal disease

# Diagnosis
Culture establishes the diagnosis. The organisms grow slowly and identification of the organism may take several days. _C. canimorsus_ is more fastidious than other species and requires enriched agar; blood cultures turn positive after 1 to 14 days (mean 6 days) of incubation

# Management
## Acute Infection
- IV antibiotics:
	- beta-lactam beta-lactamase combination (pip-tazo) or a carbapenem
- PO antibiotics:
	- Amox-clav
- Guide therapy based on susceptibility testing.
- Capnocytophaga species can be resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, aztreonam, and fluoroquinolones
- There are no standard durations of therapy.

## Prevention
Antibiotic prophylaxis with amox-clav for five days following a dog bite is appropriate for patients at highest risk (including patients with asplenia, patients with alcohol use disorder, patients receiving corticosteroids, or patients who are otherwise immunocompromised).
