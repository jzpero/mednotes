Legionella Infection
====================

Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis
-------------------------------------

### Legionnaire's disease (pneumonia)

*   clinical features
    *   similar to other forms of pneumonia - fever, cough, SOB -Â  respiratory symptoms preceded often by fever and fatigue
    *   2-10 days post exposure to contaminated water or soil
    *   radiographic findings are nonspecific - most commonly patchy unilobar infiltrates that progress to consolidations
    *   associated with:
        *   GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
        *   hyponatremia
        *   liver enzyme elevations
        *   CRP > 100
        *   failure to respond to beta-lactam monotherapy
    *   ranges in severity from mild to severe
    *   Clinical features of Legionnaires' disease do not appear to vary with the infecting species or serotypes
*   **diagnosis**
    *   **suspect Legionella with:**
        *   any pneumonia
        *   known outbreaks - water contamination in large facilities
        *   contaminated water sources such as hot tubs, fountains; exposures to soil or potting mix
    *   **risk factors**
        *   older age, smoking, chronic disease
    *   **no specific guidelines to test, but:**
        *   All patients with moderate to severe CAP or patients with CAP who require hospitalization
        *   Any patient with CAP or nosocomial pneumonia who has a known or possible exposure to _Legionella_ (eg, during an outbreak)
        *   Immunocompromised patients (who are at higher risk for _Legionella_ infection and severe disease)
    *   **approach to testing**
        *   When testing for _Legionella_ in patients with pneumonia, we prefer to use PCR on a lower respiratory tract sample (eg, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage specimen) because PCR has high diagnostic accuracy and detects all _Legionella_ species and serogroups.
        *   If PCR is not available or if sputum cannot be obtained, urine antigen testing is an acceptable alternative, especially in regions such as the United States where the prevalence of _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 is high. The main advantages of the urinary antigen test are its rapid turnaround time and high specificity.
            *   sensitivity of urine antigen tests ranges from approximately 70 to 80 percent and the specificity approaches 100 percent in patients with Legionnaires' disease caused by _L. pneumophila_ serotype 1
            *   _L. pneumophila_ serotype 1 causes over 80 percent of reported cases of Legionnaires' disease in most regions of the world

### Pontiac fever (febrile illness)

*   acute, self-limited febrile illness, which can follow exposure to several _Legionella_ species
*   Symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, headache, chills, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
*   Symptom onset occurs approximately 4 to 60 hours after exposure (median 36 hours)
*   The duration of illness ranges from one to nine days (median four days) and typically resolves without specific therapy
*   In contrast with Legionnaires' disease (_Legionella_ pneumonia), signs and symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection are absent
*   Because Pontiac fever is typically self-limited, testing is usually not performed unless part of an epidemiologic investigation

### Extrapulmonary infection

Causes all sorts of infections: SSTI, joints, bones, myocardium and pericardium, cardiac valves, kidneys, etc...

Treatment
---------

### Legionella pneumonia

*   **empiric treatment**
    *   For most patients with CAP, the etiology is not known at the time of diagnosis, and empiric treatment is appropriate
    *   generally include an antibiotic that targets _Legionella_ (eg, a **fluoroquinolone or macrolide**) when selecting an empiric antibiotic regimen for most patients with CAP
    *   generally avoid tetracyclines (**doxycycline**) for legionellosis
*   **directed treatment**
    *   **Levofloxacin** and **azithromycin** are the preferred directed agents.  
        *   cohort studies have not found differences in mortality when comparing levofloxacin with azithromycin
        *   Higher doses of levofloxacin (ie, 750 mg daily) may lead to faster symptom resolution than lower doses (500 mg daily); therefore choose higher doses when using this drug
        *   Combination therapy using both a fluoroquinolone and a macrolide does not appear to improve outcomes
    *   **Duration of therapy**
        *   optimal duration of therapy for the treatment of Legionnaires' disease has not been determined
        *   treat for a minimum of five days and do not stop therapy until the patient is clinically stable and afebrile for at least 48 hours
*   **response to treatment**
    *   Most patients with Legionnaires' disease respond promptly to treatment, defervescing in approximately two to five days. Resolution of radiographic changes often lag behind clinical improvement, though most clear over a period of two month
    *   For patients who are slow to respond to treatment, complications such as lung abscess, empyema, or extrapulmonary infection should be considered. Coinfection with other pathogens is rare

### Pontiac fever

Pontiac fever is usually short lived and resolves spontaneously after three to five days. Specific therapy is not needed.

### Extrapulmonary disease

Patients with extrapulmonary infections (eg, cellulitis, skin abscesses, septic arthritis, myocarditis, or endocarditis) are most often treated with a fluoroquinolone. Generally, longer courses of therapy are required for patients with extrapulmonary legionellosis than with Legionnaires' disease.
