Klebsiella are ubiquitous Gram-negative, non-motile bacteria within the Enterobacteriaceae family, which includes well-studied human pathogens like Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia.

Typically a GI pathogen, with the reservoir leading to human infection being the person's own gut.

Hypermucoviscous (HMV) and hypervirulent are often used synonymously in the literature; however, not all patients with a hypervirulent phenotype have hypermucoviscous bacteria and not all hypermucoviscous isolates lead to an invasive syndrome

-   Increased virulence of hvKp over classical (cKp)
-   Capable of causing severe organ and life threatening disease.
-   Tendency for metastatic spread of disease.
-   Increasing prevalence over time, especially in Asia
