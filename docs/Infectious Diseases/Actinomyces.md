These species are microaerophilic/anaerobic Gram positive rods, that can be part of the normal aspirated flora, especially with poor oral hygiene. Usually caused by *Actinomyces israelii*.

# Clinical Manifestations
-   Indolent, slowly progressive lesions
-   Lung parenchymal lesions are associated with pleural infection leading to pleural thickening and empyema
	- Can be mistaken for lung cancer
	-   The organism can break through fascial planes: spontaneous drainage of empyema through the chest
	- "sulfur granules" in purulent exudate represents clusters of branching Actinomyces filament
	- More common in alcoholics and those with poor dental hygeine

# Diagnosis
-   Gram stain -- branching forms, weakly gram positive
-   Acid-fast stain negative
-   Slow growth, minimum 5-7 days for identification

# Treatment
1. IV PCN or ampicillin
2. followed by oral oral penicillin, amox, amox/clav for total duration of 6 month
3. Followup for at least 3 years due to high risk of recurrence
