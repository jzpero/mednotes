# Infective Endocarditis

## Definitions & Background

Bacterial vegetations comprised of platelets, fibrin, microorganisms, and inflammatory cells generally involve the heart valves and intracardiac devices.

**Endothelial injury** allows for either direct infection or formation of a nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis \(NBTE\) which can become infected during transient bacteremia. More virulent bugs tend to adhere directly to the endothelium. Other bugs tend to adhere to the NBTE. Risk factors for NBTE are valvular defects \(MR, AS, AR\), VSD, CHD, hypercoagulable states \(marantic endocarditis\), SLE, and antiphospholipid syndrome.

Organisms deep within the vegetation are metabolically inactive and difficult to eradicate. Embolization of vegetation fragments can lead to distant infection or infarction. Intracardiac structures can be damaged \(perivalvular abscesses, conduction blocks\), and tissue damage arises from immune complex deposition or responses to deposited bacterial antigens.

**Risk factors** are fairly obvious:

* congenital heart diseases
* chronic rheumatic heart disease
* IV drug use
* degenerative valves
* intracardiac devices \([ICD](../Cardiology/Ischemic%20Heart%20Disease/ICDs%20Post-ACS.md), pacemaker, etc\)
* old age
* prosthetic valves
  * bioprosthetics and mechanicals have similar risk profiles
  * risk is greatest in the first 6 to 12 mo
  * risk declines to a low, stable level after

**Causative organisms** are typically bacteria, but can be fungal as well.

Breakdowns of common bugs varies by population and valve replacement status, but _Streptococci_ and _Staph aureus_ are by far the two most common.

Some conditions can mimic infectious endocarditis:

* atrial myxoma
* marantic endocarditis
* antiphospholipid syndrome/lupus (Libman-Sacks endocarditis)

## Clinical Manifestations

The **timecourse and aggression** of disease is dictated by the causative organism.

* **Acute endocarditis** is a febrile and aggressive disease. It causes rapid damage to cardiac structures, seeds extracardiac sites, and causes death within weeks of untreated.
  * beta-hemolytic strep, Staph aureus, pneumococci
* **Subacute endocarditis** has a more indolent course. It causes slow progressive damage and rarely metastasizes unless there is a major embolic event or rupture of a mycotic aneurysm.
  * viridans Strep, CoNS, HACEK, Bartonella, Whipple's disease, Staph aureus

**Symptoms** are extremely broad:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Systemic" %}
* **Fever** \(low in subacute, high in acute\)
  * be wary of poor febrile response in the elderly, severely ill, and renal failure
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Cardiac" %}
* **new regurgitant murmurs** \(85%\)
* **congestive heart failure** from valve failure or fistula formation
* **perivalvular abscess**
* **heart block**
* **myocardial infarction** due to coronary artery embolus
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Extracardiac" %}
* Janeway lesions
* **Osler's nodes and splinter hemorrhages** due septic embolization common in acute Staph aureus infectious endocarditis
* MSK pain
* Distal infection
* Arterial emboli
* Neurologic complications
* Renal dysfunction

You should know the **Duke Criteria** which is a highly sensitive and specific set of clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic findings of infective endocarditis. It emphasizes bacteremia and echocardiography.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To satisfy the criteria, you must have one of the following combinations:

* [ ] 2 major 
* [ ] 1 major + 3 minor
* [ ] 5 minor
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Major Criteria" %}
1. **Positive blood culture,** meaning _one_ of the following
   1. [ ] typical bug in two separate BCx:
      1. [ ] viridans _Strep_, _Strep gallolyticus \(bovis\)_, HACEK, _Staph aureus_; OR
      2. [ ] community-acquired enterococci, in the absence of a primary focus
   2. [ ] persistently positive BCx:
      1. [ ] BCx drawn more than 12 h apart
      2. [ ] all of 3, or a majority of 4 or more, separate BCx, with the first and last more than 1 h apart
   3. [ ] single positive BCx for _Coxiella burnetti \(Q fever\)_, or a phase I IgG antibody titre of &gt;1:800
2. **Evidence of endocardial involvement,** meaning _one_ of the following
   1. [ ] positive echocardiogram
   2. [ ] _new_ valvular regurgitation

{% tab title="Minor Criteria" %}
1. **Predisposition**
2. **Fever**
3. **Vascular**
4. **Immunologic**
5. **Microbiologic**

## Investigations & Diagnosis

**Blood cultures** are necessary to draw early on. Obtain 3 two-bottle sets, separated by 2+ hours, if no antibiotics have been received within the past two weeks.

{% hint style="success" %}
* If stable and **with subacute endocarditis, withhold empiric antibiotics until cultures result**.
* If unstable or with acute endocarditis, draw cultures immediately and give empiric antibiotics after.
{% endhint %}

5 to 15% of cases have negative blood cultures, and much of this is due to either prior antibiotic exposure or fastidious organisms.

**Serology** can be drawn for _Brucella, Bartonella, Legionella, Chlamydia psittaci, and Coxiella burnetti_, if you think these are likely.

**Transesophageal echocardiography \(TEE\)** is an absolutely essential test to rule out or assess infectious endocarditis. Extremely specific, but cannot image vegetations less than 2 mm diameter. False negative rate is 6 to 18% in initial imaging, and so likely endocarditis may require a second TEE in 7 to 10 days if the first TEE is negative.

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Staphylococcus aureus**_ **bacteremia is an indication for routine TEE**, due to the high prevalence of infective endocarditis with this bug.
{% endhint %}

**Other imaging** is less common, and may involve 3D TEE or FGD-PET/CT.
