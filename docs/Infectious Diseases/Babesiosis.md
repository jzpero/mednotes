Babesiosis is an infectious disease caused by *Babesia* protozoa, transmitted mainly by ticks. Causes mammalian infections and RBC lysis.

# Epidemiology
-   Primary reservoir = white footed mice or other small mammals. Primary vector = nymphial stage of *Ixodes scapularis* tick.
-   Generally occurs in NE USA, upper Midwest (includes Ontario regions). Increasing incidence rate and a high population seroprevalance rate.

## Transmission
- Ticks: May to September, Nymphial stage, feed on deer and small mammals
- Blood transfusion, organ transplantation, transplacental
- Coinfection with other tick-borne illnesses is common:
	-   Lyme disease (1/2)
	-   Anaplasma
	-   Powassan virus
	-   Erlichia muris-like agent

## Risk Factors
- Endemic area, travel
- Blood transfusion
- Asplenia/hyposplenia, immunosuppression, HIV, malignancy, prematurity, increased age

# Pathogenesis
- **RBC hemolysis** due to release of merozoites from RBCs and loss of cell membrane integrity
- **CD4+ t cell function** is integral to host immunity, and disease is more severe in HIV+ and in those on cellular immunity antagonists
- - severity depends on risk factors and parasitemia:
	- mild to moderate disease: immunocompetent, parasitemia <4%
	- severe disease: risk factors and parasitemia >4%

# Clinical Presentation
- incubation period: 1-4 weeks from a tick bite; 3-7 weeks from blood products
- many patients are completely asymptomatic
- lymphadenopathy is classically ABSENT
- complications can be broad:
	- ARDS (most common)
	- severe anemia
	- renal failure
	- splenic infarct or rupture
	- warm [AIHA](../Hematology/Anemia/Autoimmune%20Hemolytic%20Anemias.md)

| System           | Manifestations                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Hematologic      | hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia |
| constitutional   | fever, arthralgias                 |
| gastrointestinal | hepatosplenomegaly, transaminitis  |

# Diagnosis
- clinical syndrome as above
- laboratory findings of [hemolytic anemia](../Hematology/Anemia/Hemolytic%20Anemia.md), thrombocytopenia, mixed transaminitis
- epidemiologic exposure risk
- *Babesia* serology as a screening test
- thin blood smears (**Maltese cross**, trophozoites, parasitemia %)
- PCR for *Babesia* DNA

# Treatment 
Per the 2020 IDSA Guidelines:

1. **B microti**
	1. Azithromycin + atovaquone (first-line)
	2. Clindamycin + quinine (alternative)
2. **B divergens**
	1. Clindamycin + quinine

- duration is 7-10 days. If immunocompromised and high risk of relapse, treat for at least 6 consecutive weeks and until at least 2 weeks of consecutive peripheral blood smears are negative.
- consider exchange transfusion if parasitemia > 10% or for severe hemolysis or organ failure. 
- monitor with peripheral smears
- Treat relapses with another repeat course of antibiotics (same course OK if tolerated).
