# Urinary Tract Infections

Acute uncomplicated UTI:

-   E coli (75-90%)

-   Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5-15%)

    -   Especially in young, sexually active women

-   Klebsiella

-   Proteus mirabilis

-   Citrobacter

-   Enterococcus

 

Complicated UTI:

-   Same as above, but also:

-   Pseudomonas

-   Acinetobacter

-   Morganella

-   Staphylococcus

-   Yeast

-   In 95% of cases, UTIs are monomicrobial

 

# Diagnosis & Workup

-   **Urinalysis** should be performed for all patients with possible UTI

    -   &gt;10 WBC/HPF indicates pyuria

    -   Leukocyte esterase dipstick is generally sensitive, but can have false negs

    -   WBC casts is strong evidence for pyelonephritis

    -   Increased protein is common as well

-   **Urine culture** allows for quantitation to differentiate contamination (usual) from active infection

    -   Not required in sexually active women with early cystitis

    -   More than 10<sup>5</sup> organisms per mL indicates infection, but sympatomatic women can have as few as 10<sup>3</sup> per mL

    -   <u>The IDSA recommends &gt;10<sup>3</sup> per mL as an indication of infection in symptomatic patients</u>

    -   Follow-up with repeat culture if symptoms relapse

-   **Ultrasound** to image:

    -   Patients with upper tract disease, and persistent fever, on antibiotics

    -   Preschool girls with second UTI

    -   Any male with UTI

-   **IV pyelogram** to work up anatomic obstruction, but avoid in MM or AKI

-   **CT abdomen** for perinephric abscess, anatomic defects, obstruction, calculi, etc

 

# Principles of Management 

# Uncomplicated Cystitis

-   Background:

    -   Should be treated if symptomatic, and pregnant women should have all ASB treated as well

    -   Most can be treated over the phone, without physical examiantion

    -   TMP-SMX used to be the first line therapy in 1999, but now there is no single best agent

-   **Antibiotic Regimens**

    -   <u>First-Line</u>

        -   *TMP-SMX*

            -   Dose: 1 double strength tablet BID for 3 days

            -   Increasing resistance, consider if local resistance &lt;20%

        -   *Nitrofurantoin*

            -   Dose: 100 mg bid for 5-7 days

            -   Resistance remains fairly low

            -   Highly active against E coli and most non-E coli isolates

            -   Proteus, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Enterobacter, and yeast are intrinsically resistant

            -   Do NOT use to treat pyelonephritis, does not reach therapeutic levels in the tissue

        -   *Fosfomycin*

            -   Retains activity against a majority of uropathogens that produce extended spectrum beta-lactamases

            -   Single 3 gram dose

            -   This is less effective than a 5 day course of nitrofurantoin

        -   *Pivmecillinam*

            -   May not be available in Canada

    -   <u>Second-Line</u>

        -   *Fluoroquinolones*

            -   Highly effective (cipro or levo), except for moxi (low urinary levels)

            -   Issues:

                -   Resistance

                -   Side effects

                    -   Achilles tendinopathy

                    -   Irreversible neuropathy

            -   Therefore, use when other choices are not reasonable

        -   *Beta-lactams*

            -   Less effective; fail to eliminate uropathogens from the vaginal reservoir

            -   Many strains of E coli that are resistant to TMP-SMX are also resistant to amoxicillin and cephalexin

    -   <u>Duration of Therapy</u>

        -   Avoid short course (5 days) of therapy in men, upper tract symptoms, women with symptoms more than a week in duration, diabetics

 

# Pyelonephritis

-   Background:

    -   Tissue-invasive disease

    -   Treatment needs to work, and needs to reach therapeutic levels very quickly

    -   There are high rates of TMP-SMX resistant E coli in patients with pyelonephritis

    -   Requires a longer duration of therapy

    -   Uncomplicated

    -   responds to 7 days well, otherwise 14 days is reasonable

-   **Antibiotic Regimens**

    -   <u>First-Line</u>

        -   *Fluoroquinolones*

            -   PO or IV are bioequivalent

            -   7-day course is highly effective for initial management in the outpatient setting

            -   *Preferred for empiric therapy*

        -   *TMP-SMX*

            -   PO x 14 days is effective for uncomplicated pyelonephritis if the pathogen is known to be susceptible

            -   If the susceptibility is unknown, use with an initial dose of ceftriaxone 1 gram IV

        -   *Amox-clav*

    -   <u>Parenteral (more serious disease)</u>

        -   Fluoroquinolones

        -   Extended spectrum cephalosporin +/- aminoglycoside

            -   *IV ceftriaxone, if there is no history of MDR pathogen or recent hospitalizations*

        -   Carbapenem

        -   *Once there is clinical response, should switch to oral from parenteral*

    -   <u>Higher-Risk Patients</u>

        -   Beta-lactam + beta-lactamase-inhibitor

            -   *Pip-tazo (pseudomonas)*

        -   *Cefepime (pseudomonas coverage)*

        -   Carbapenem

            -   ESBL

    -   Consider previous urine cultures to guide initial empiric coverage

 

# UTI in Pregnant Women

-   **Nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, and cephalosporins are relatively safe in early pregnancy**

-   Pregnant women with overt pyelonephritis should get parenteral beta-lactam +/- aminoglycoside

-   AVOID:

    -   Sulfonamides

    -   Fluoroquinolones

 

# Prevention of UTI

-   **Sexually active women:**

    -   Void after sex

    -   Single-dose TMP-SMX after sex

-   **Anatomic defects and children:**

    -   Daily low dose (1/2 tab) TMP-SMX daily, or 50 mg nitrofurantoin daily

-   **Indwelling catheters:**

    -   Abx ppx is not effective, and selects for antibiotic-resistant pathogens

    -   Remove catheters ASAP
