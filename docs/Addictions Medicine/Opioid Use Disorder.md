# Opioid Use Disorder
## Opioid Withdrawal
- clinical manifestations
	- yawning
	- sniffing, lacrimation, rhinorrhea
	- goosebumps
	- mydriasis

## Opioid Agonist Therapy
### Buprenorphine
Buprenorphine is a competitive partial opioid agonist used in the treatment of opioid use disorder via chronic maintenance therapy (similar to methadone maintenance therapy).

Sometimes combined with naloxone (anti-abuse mechanism) which doesn't really absorb through the GI tract (as opposed to methylnaloxone)

#### Buprenorphine Maintenance
When admitted to hospital, continue the same outpatient dose if the last known dose was within 3-4 days. If greater than this, involve addictions and consider dose reduction initially.

#### Buprenorphine Induction
##### Indications
- Adequate withdrawal to tolerate withdrawal: Use the COWS score to show moderate withdrawal or worse (COWS 13 and above).
- need to know the last dose of opioid taken

##### Contraindications
- Actively intoxicated --> can precipitate acute withdrawal as this is a partial opioid receptor agonist.
- Partial contraindication - be wary of methadone users - too long half-life, fentanyl (context-sensitive half-life).

##### Procedure
1. Give suboxone SL (2-4 mg, 1-2 tablets). Measure COWS in 1 hour to see if there has been a response (decreased).
2. Continue re-dosing them throughout the night.
3. End-point:  once they feel comfortable!
