# Buprenorphine Induction
Buprenorphine is a competitive partial opioid agonist used in the treatment of opioid use disorder via chronic maintenance therapy (similar to methadone maintenance therapy).

Sometimes combined with naloxone (anti-abuse mechanism) which doesn't really absorb through the GI tract (as opposed to methylnaloxone)

## Indications
- Adequate withdrawal to tolerate withdrawal: Use the COWS score: moderate withdrawal or worse (COWS 13 and above).
- need to know the last dose of opioid taken

## Contraindications
Actively intoxicated --> can precipitate acute withdrawal as this is a partial opioid receptor agonist.

Partial - be wary of methadone users - too long half-life, fentanyl (context-sensitive half-life).

## Procedure
1. Give suboxone SL (2-4 mg, 1-2 tablets). Measure COWS in 1 hour to see if there has been a response (decreased).
2. Continue re-dosing them throughout the night.
3. End-point:  once they feel comfortable!
