# Hypoglycemia


# Differential Diagnosis
- **Insulin over-production**
	- Insulinomas
- **Insulin over-exposure**
	- Iatrogenic overdose
	- Self-induced overdose
- **Paraneoplastic syndromes**
	- IGF-2 overproduction by malignancies. This leads to increased glucose utilization by skeletal muscles and inhibition of gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and glucose release in the liver.
		- **Nonislet cell tumours**, which tend to be large (2-4 kg) and found in the thorax (1/3) or the retroperitoneum (2/3).
			- Mesenchymal tumours
			- Vascular tumours
			- Epithelial cell types (ex. HCC)
		- **Doege-Potter Syndrome** is a very rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with [Solitary Fibrous Tumours](../Oncology/Solitary%20Fibrous%20Tumours.md) secondary to autonomous overproduction of IGF-2
			- High-dose glucocorticoids (prendisone 20 mg or more daily) can reduce the production of IGF-2 in the tumour
