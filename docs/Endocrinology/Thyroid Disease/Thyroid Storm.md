# Thyroid Storm

Severe thyrotoxicosis - manifested by organ failure.

## Manifestations
Thyroid storm is a very rare diagnosis - consider in the following presentations at least!

-   (1) Patient with known hyperthyroidism plus any acute illness/deterioration.
-   (2) New-onset atrial fibrillation and/or dilated cardiomyopathy.
-   (3) New-onset delirium/psychosis plus abnormal vital signs (fever, tachycardia).
-   (4) Hyperthermia (temperature above ~40C).
-   (5) Septic-appearing patient without any focus of infection (i.e. distributive shock of unknown origin).

Thyroid storm usually presents as a mimic of another alternative diagnosis.

- Cardiac: tachycardia, arrhythmia, high output failure, pulmonary edema, hypertension
- Neurologic: delirium, agitation, psychosis, stupor, coma
- Hyperthermia (>40-41 degrees C with diaphoresis)
- GI: N/V/D, abdominal pain, jaundice or liver failure
- 

## Triggers of Thyroid Storm
- Infection
- Surgery or trauma
- Pulmonary embolism, MI, stroke
- Pregnancy related conditions
- DKA, hypoglycemia
- Thyroid-related precipitants

## Diagnosis and Investigations
The diagnosis is a clinical diagnosis in the presence of proven hyperthyroidism.

- Thyroid labs:
	- Thyroid labs _aren't necessarily worse than uncomplicated hyperthyroidism_. The differentiation between hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm is based on _clinical findings â€“_ not how severe the lab abnormality is.
	- TSH will be very low or undetectable
	- Elevated free T4, T3 is excessively elevated as well
- Other possible labs:
	- Hyperglycemia
	- WBC abnormalities
	- LFT abnormalities
	- DIC
- The **Burch-Wartofsky scale** is used as a clinical measure of the likelihood of thyroid storm in a patient with known hyperthyroidism.
	- 45 or more: Highly suggestive of thyroid storm.
	-   25-44: Supports diagnosis of thyroid storm or impending storm.
	-   <25: Thyroid storm unlikely.
