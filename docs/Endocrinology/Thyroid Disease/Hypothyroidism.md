# Hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism is a clinical syndrome resulting from a deficiency of thyroid hormones, with widespread organ-specific effects. In infants and children: slowing of growth and development with serious permanent consequences. In adults, clinical manifestations are due to thyroxine deficiency (T4) and insufficient cellular effects of T3: (1) slowing of cellular metabolism (2) development of interstitial edema due to delayed metabolism of glycosaminoglycans.

## Pathophysiology
T4 is peripherally converted to the active form, T3. Majority of T3 comes from deiodination in the liver and is done on an as-needed basis - therefore the levels are difficult to interpret as a diagnostic test.

# Classification and Etiology of Hypothyroidism
1. **Transient**
	2. Silent thyroiditis, including postpartum
	3. Subacute thyroiditis
	4. Withdrawal of supraphysiologic thyroxine treatment
2. **Primary (thyroid gland)**
	2. Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's): most common cause in the developed world
		1. Associated with TPO Ab, other autoimmune diseases (DM2, SLE, RA). More common in women, and younger people tend to have a goiter
	3. Thyroidectomy
	4. Neck radiation
	5. Radioiodine treatment
	6. Excessive iodine intake (Wolff-Chiakoff effect)
		1. amiodarone
		2. iodine contrast media
	7. Antithyroid drugs
	8. Lithium salts
	9. Environmental iodine deficiency 
	10. Infiltrative diseases
	11. Congenital hypothyroidism
3. **Secondary (hypopituitarism)**
	1. Parasellar mass
	2. Inflammatory of infiltrative disease
	3. Vascular, traumatic, iatrogenic
	4. Sheehan syndrome
4. **Tertiary (too little TRH release)**

# Treatment
## Long-Term Hormonal Replacement
- **Levothyroxine (L-T4) monotherapy**
	- Frequency: OD, qam or qhs, long half life so only take once a day. Just be consistent and pragmatic.
	- Absorption issues common with
		- Iron
		- Soy products (be careful in children on soy milk)
	- Dosage: *~1.6 mcg/kg/d (lean body mass) in adults, with less in elderly*. For most adults this is 100 to 150 mcg/d. Since this is lean body mass, for obese patients consider using 1.4 mcg/kg/d
	- Titrate to TSH in the reference range (2-3 mIU/L),
		- In young healthy adults, start with a full replacement dose and target a low-normal TSH.
		- In older people (65+) titrate up slowly. Start with 25-50 mcg and move up by increments of 12.5-25 mcg. Target is high normal range.
		- Titrate via measuring TSH 4-8 weeks after start and after new therapies
		- Sensitive to generic/branding/formulation. May need to recheck TSH if preparation changes. Especially important with thyroid cancer that needs narrow ranges.
- **Iodine products should not be used** in regions with adequate iodine intake except in pregnant women
- **Start cortisol first with coexisting adrenal insufficiency**
	- This is because the half-life of the serum cortisol normalizes, and this can trigger an acute adrenal crisis with underlying adrenal insufficiency
- **Monitoring of treatment via serum TSH should be done at ~6 weeks** since last adjustment. If secondary or tertiary, use the FT4. Symptom resolution will lag behind T4 normalization by 2-3 months.
- **Increasing the dose** may be necessary with:
	- Oral LT4 malabsorption
	- Drugs that cause malabsorption --> space out by a few hours
	- Starting estrogen products (increases the TBG)
