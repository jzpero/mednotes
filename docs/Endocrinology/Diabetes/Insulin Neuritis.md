# Treatment-induced neuropathy of diabetes (TIND)
## Background

- rare, iatrogenic small fiber neuropathy
- due to abrupt improvement in glycemic control in the setting of chronic hyperglycemia/untreated DM
- high prevalance in tertiary DM clinics (about 10%)
- risk is associated with the rate and magnitude of change in A1C
- risk increased with T1DM and Hx of eating disorders
- occurs with both insulin and oral antihyperglycemics


## Presentation
- no specific cutoffs, but about >2% A1C improvement over 3 months
- new onset **neuropathic pain and/or autonomic dysfunction**:
    - allodynia, hyperalgesia
    - paraesthesias
    - erectile dysfunction
    - orthostatic intolerance
    - (pre) syncope
    - postprandial fullness
    - anorexia, early satiety
    - hyper/anhidrosis
- **progression in retinopathy**
- **progression in microalbuminuria**


## Management
- "permissive hyperglycemia" has been proposed but evidence for/against is lacking
- typically initially refractory to treatment, particularly pain, but will improve over time (months)
- symptomatic treatment can consist of:
    - prokinetic agents such as erythromycin/domperidone for gastroparesis
    - ivabradine or other negative chronotropes for tachycardia
    - fludrocortisone for postural hypotension
    - pregabalin for neuropathic pain
