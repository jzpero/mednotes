Adrenal incidentaloma (AI) is defined as a clinically unapparent adrenal mass > 1 cm in diameter detected during imaging performed for reasons other than for suspected adrenal disease.

**Guidelines do not recommend that incidentally found adrenal lesions < 1cm undergo further investigations unless clinically indicated.**

# Evaluation of AIs
## 1 - Structural Evaluation
Essentially perform a **noncontrast CT adrenal protocol** to look for features of malignancy (size, HU). For lesions with HU > 10, then further imaging is required and there is no consensus on the best option (consider chemical shift MR, FDG PET-CT, SPECT-CT)

| Benign Features        | Non-Benign Features |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Size < 4 cm            | Size > 4 cm         |
| Houndsfield units < 10 | HU > 10             |
| homogenous density     | heterogenous (calcifications, extension, adenopathy)        |
|                        | hypervascularity, <50% delayed contrast washout    |

## 2 - Functional Evaluation
- *Screen for hypercortisolism and pheochromocytoma in ALL adrenal incidentalomas.*
	- Hypercortisolism
		- 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (preferred over other tests such as 24h UFC, late night salivary cortisol, 9am plasma cortisol)
			- should also have low ACTH +/- low DHEAS to support the diagnosis
	- Pheochromocytoma
		- urinary metanephrines
		- plasma free metanephrines
- *Screen for hyperaldosteronism* (Conn syndrome) only if there is hypertension +/- hypokalemia.
	- plasma renin:aldo ratio (PRA)
