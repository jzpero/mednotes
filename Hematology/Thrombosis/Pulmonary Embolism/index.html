<li>Contentious area. A 2021 <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M21-2981">study</a> found that the risk of 90-day recurrent VTE in non-anticoagulated patients with isolated single SSPE was ~2%, and those with multiple is about ~5.7%. Interesting, the 90-day risk of recurrent VTE in patients treated with anticoagulation is approx 3% based on prior studies. Therefore, there might not be a clinically significant risk reduction with full anticoagulation for patients with a single SSPE.</li>
<li>The 2021 CHEST guidelines recommend <strong>surveillence</strong> over anticoagulation for those with low risk of recurrent VTE, and <strong>anticoagulation</strong> over surveillance for those at high risk of recurrent VTE. This only applies if proximal DVT is ruled out (with ultrasonography)</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">What is the takeaway?</p>
<p>As of 2022, if the patient has a single SSPE and no particular risk factors for recurrence or decompensation (active cancer, cardiopulmonary poor dysfunction, completely unprovoked), and bilateral compression US is negative for DVT, then <em>it is reasonable to consider no anticoagulation</em> and close monitoring instead (with perhaps repeat ultrasounds in 2-3 weeks).</p>
</div>
<h1 id="thrombolysis">Thrombolysis</h1>
<ul>
<li>Hold anticoagulation (IV heparin) before and during the infusion. Fully anticoagulate patients with IV UFH afterwards (resume without bolus when aPTT &lt;2x ULN). Then, transition to oral agent once stable for 24-48 hours.</li>
<li>a consistent finding among studies is that thrombolytic therapy leads to early hemodynamic improvement and, although a mortality benefit may exist, it occurs at a cost of increased major bleeding. Per the ESC 2019 guidelines: Thrombolytic therapy leads to faster improvements in pulmonary obstruction, PAP, and PVR in patients with PE, compared with UFH alone; these improvements are accompanied by a reduction in RV dilation on echocardiography.</li>
<li>10% risk of severe bleeding, 1.7% risk of <a href="../../../Critical%20Care/Neuro%20Critical%20Care/Intracranial%20Hemorrhage/">intracranial hemorrhage</a> (SRMA)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="massive-pe_1">Massive PE</h2>
<ul>
<li>FDA approved regimen: IV tPA (alteplase) 100 mg over 2 hours.</li>
<li>Consider in more urgent situations (none are shown to be superior)<ul>
<li>infusion over 15 minutes</li>
<li>20 mg IV bolus then 80 mg IV over 2 hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intermediate-risk-pe">Intermediate Risk PE</h2>
<p>While not routinely considered, thrombolysis can be considered for patients on anticoagulation who are decompensating or have higher risk of early mortality, anticoagulation treatment.</p>
<p>Some studies (particularly <strong>PEITHO</strong>) have examined thrombolysis in submassive PE and generally find no balanced benefit from thrombolysis (perhaps improved hemodynamic or <a href="../../../Respirology/Pulmonary%20Hypertension/">pulmonary hypertension</a> status, against increased bleeding risk). The <strong>MOPETT</strong> study used a particular regimen of tPA 0.5 mg/kg (up to a max of 50 mg) given as a 10 mg bolus followed by the remainder over 2 hours (i.e. reduced dose) for a particular definition of submassive PE ("moderate", with few patients having RV dysfunction); it showed that the risk of <a href="../../../Respirology/Pulmonary%20Hypertension/">pulmonary hypertension</a> was reduced compared to anticoagulation alone.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">PEITHO (NEJM 2014)</p>
<p>Among patients with submassive PE being treated with unfractionated heparin, administration of tenecteplase (30-50 mg IV once over 5-10 seconds) reduces a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or hemodynamic decompensation at 7 days when compared to placebo, though this was driven by reduced hemodynamic decompensation. Tenecteplase was associated with increased rates of major extracranial bleeding at 7 days (6.3% vs. 1.2%; P&lt;0.001; NNH 20) and strokes at 7 days (2.4% vs. 0.2%; P=0.004; NNH 45).</p>
</div>
<h2 id="cardiac-arrest">Cardiac Arrest</h2>
<ul>
<li>Give a 50 mg IV tPA <em>bolus</em> over 2 minutes, consider also starting a vasopressor early  if in PEA arrest (obtain aterial access, use POCUS ECHO!). Follow with another 50 mg IV bolus after 15 minutes in the absence of ROSC.</li>
<li>once a thrombolytic drug is administered, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be continued for at least 60–90 min before terminating resuscitation attempts (ESC 2019)</li>
