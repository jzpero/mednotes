    <h1 id="gdmt-in-hfref">GDMT in HFrEF</h1>
<p>GDMT refers to the set of medical and device interventions that have been shown to decrease important MACE +/- improve mortality in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (of mostly all types). These are informed by guidelines from the CCS, AHA, and the ESC.</p>
<p>The goal of GDMT and HFrEF treatment is optimisation of LVEF, reduction of symptoms (NYHA I goal), and to decrease the risk of sudden cardiac death.</p>
<h1 id="first-line-gdmt">First-Line GDMT</h1>
<h2 id="raas-inhibition">RAAS Inhibition</h2>
<p>Prior evidence and guidelines recommended initiation of ACEi or ARB. New evidence suggests strongly that all patients should be on ARNI therapy preferentially, and this is reflected in most recent guidance from the CCS (2021 Focused Update).</p>
<p><em>Guideline (CCS) Recommendations:</em>
1. We recommend an ACE inhibitor, or ARB in those with ACEi intolerance, in patients with acute MI with HF or an EF &lt; 40% post-MI to be used as soon as safely possible post- MI and be continued indefinitely.
2. We recommend that an ARNI be used in place of an ACEi or ARB, in patients with HFrEF, that remain symptomatic despite treatment with appropriate doses of GDMT in order to decrease cardiovascular death, HF hospitalizations, and symptoms.
3. We recommend that patients admitted to hospital for acute decompensated HF with HFrEF should be switched to an ARNI, from an ACEI or ARB, when stabilized and before hospital discharge (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).
4. We suggest that patients admitted to hospital with a new diagnosis of HFrEF should be treated with ARNI as first-line therapy, as an alternative to either an ACEI or ARB (Weak Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).</p>

<h2 id="beta-blockade">Beta-Blockade</h2>
<p>Beta-blockers have a strong evidence base in HFrEF. In particular, there are three that are most evidenced in heart failure with reduced EF.</p>
<ul>
<li>In all trials, the mortality benefit from beta-blockers stemmed from a reduction in both progression of HF &amp; sudden cardiac death. In all these trials, patients were already on diuretics + ACE inhibitors/vasodilators. LVEF was generally &lt;25-40%. Symptoms ranged from NYHA II-IV across studies. HF was stable for 2-3 months and not acutely decompensated.</li>
<li>Many patients were on digoxin (due to the era of the trials -- late 1990s). At least 1/2 of the patients had ischemic cardiomyopathy.</li>
<li>Excluded patients: ADHF, previous/for heart transplant, SBP &lt; 100, HR &lt; 60-68, untreated 2-3 degree AVB, HF secondary to primary valvular disease, myocarditis, or reversible cardiomyopathy.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>START beta-blockers before discharge</strong>, in stabilized patients, because it improves short and intermediate-term outcomes without intolerance or extended LOS<ol>
<li>IMPACT-HF: predischarge initiation of carvedilol in stabilized patients improved the uptake of beta-blockers at 60 days, without increasing side effects of LOS</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>CONTINUE/RESTART beta-blockers before discharge</strong>, as doing so reduces in-hospital and 60-180 day mortality<ol>
<li>B-CONVINCED: in ADHF, continuation of beta-blockers is noninferior with regards to clinical improvement, 3-month mortality, BNP, LOS, but increases beta-blocker therapy at 3 months.</li>

<ul>
<li>Carvedilol is most lipophilic and therefore most likely to cause vivid dreams/hallucinations/CNS effects of beta-blockade</li>
<li>Fatigue generally is an adverse effect associated with initial dosing, and will resolve after 1-2 weeks.</li>
<li>Beta-blockers might reduce the sympathetic symptoms of hypoglycemia.</li>
<li>Risk of beta-blocker withdrawal decreases with longer half-lives</li>
