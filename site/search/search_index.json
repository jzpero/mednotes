Systolic phase - rapid icnrease in pressure to a peak, then a rapid decline. Begins with AV opening and corresponds to LV ejection phase. 2. Dicrotic notch - widely believed to represent the closure of the aortic valve 3. Diastolic phase - run-off of blood into the peripheral circulation. It is also separated into two limbs: anacrotic (upstroke) and dicrotic (downstroke). The peak corresponds to the SBP. The trough corresponds to the DBP. The MAP is calculated from the AUC instead of directly from the SBP/DBP, and can vary even with identical SBP/DBP depending on the shape of the waveform: Breaking down the pulse pressure waveform even more into its components: The pulse pressure waveform has a delay from the beginning of systole on ECG (the R wave), probably about 1/4 of a second. This is due to the time it takes for depolarization, isovolumetric contraction, LV ejection, etc etc. Systolic upstroke This is ventricular ejection. Generated by the fast-moving LV ejection wave and corresponds to the peak aortic blood flow acceleration at the opening of the AV. The slope of this segment has some vague relationship with the rate of change in LV pressure and with the competence of the aortic valve. When the slope of this component is slurred, there may be aortic stenosis. Peak systolic pressure This is the maximum pressure in the central arteries, generated during the systolic ejection. The major contributions to this variable are the LV contraction, central arterial compliance and the reflected pressure wave. The shape depends on the reflected waves coming back from terminal arterioles (high resistance vasculature) which augments the peak pressure and also can create an \"anacrotic notch\" where the reflected waves meets the initial forward wave. As one measures more distally, the effects of this are augmented (i.e. dorsalis pedis measures will have elevated peak pressures): Systolic decline This is the rapid decline in arterial pressure as the ventricular contraction comes to an end. The fall in pressure represents a period of time during which the efflux of blood from the central arterial compartment is faster than the influx of blood from the emptying left ventricle. This decline is even more rapid when there is a left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (and systole comes to an abrupt halt before the left ventricle is finished with the ejection). Dicrotic notch Widely believed to be the effect of the aortic valve closing (The valve closes and there is a sudden increase in pressure as the aortic blood volume suddenly discovers that it has nowhere else to go, apart from the peripheral circulation). It is generally believed that the peripheral dicrotic notch owes more of its shape to the vascular resistance of peripheral vessels than to the closing of the aortic valve. Diastolic run-off The diastolic run-off is the drop in pressure which occurs after the aortic valve has closed. There is no flow from the LV, but pressure does not drop suddenly - rather, it decreases gradually along an exponential curve. The reason for this is arterial \"cushioning\", or the reservoir effect of pumping blood into an elastic tube. This elastic recoil of large arteries contributes as much as 40% to the stroke volume. Significant relationship to the age/vasuclar compliance of the individual. Waveform (a) represents the radial waveform of a 25 year old person, (b) is 47 years old, and (c) is 80: End-diastolic pressure This is the pressure exerted by the vascular tree back upon the aortic valve. The diastolic pressure is what fills your coronary arteries, and should not be ignored. Abnormal Arterial Waveforms Hypertension and PVD steep systolic upstroke reflected wave with anacrotic notching Aortic Stenosis decreased systolic upstroke slope possibly lowered pulse pressure + lowered systolic peak pressure incisura is los + dicrotic notch may attenuate Aortic regurgitation typical belief is that there will be a sharp upstroke and a steep systolic decline pulse pressure will be wide \"descendent\" dicrotic notch HOCM or dynamic LVOT this is supposed to produce a \"bisferians pulse\" characterized by a sudden midsystolic pressure drop Arterial Line Damping The dynamic response of an arterial line system is tested using the \"fast flush\" test, where the transducer is briefly exposed to pressure straight from the counterpressure bag. When the fast flush abruptly ends, the transducer system oscillates at its natural frequency. This can be measured and assessed for adequacy. The time between oscillation \"peaks\" gives you the natural frequency of the system; i.e. a system with 50 msec between peaks has a natural frequency of 20Hz. The transducer system needs to have a natural frequency in excess of 24 Hz in order to resolve fine features of the arterial line trace (eg. dicrotic notch) Square Wave Test After a fast flush, the system returns to baseline and harmonically oscillates a few times. The bounces can help you determine the damping of the system. Regardless of damping however, the MAP should remain the same. Note: the transducer needs to be levelled as well as zeroed to be properly calibrated: - Transducer height (levelling) \u2013 needs to be at level of right atrium (phlebostatic axis) . For every 10cm below the phlebostatic axis the transducer will add 7.4mmHg of pressure and vice versa. - \u201cZero-ing\u201d \u2013 important to ensure transducer zeroed. This ensures that the transducer references atmospheric pressure as zero. Normal damping: - short time between oscillations (<20-30 ms) - 1-2 bounce oscillations - distint dicrotic notch (can be lost in some cardiovascular conditions) Overdamping leads to underestimated systolic and overestimated diastolic pressure (tendency towards the mean) dicrotic notch is lost due to a blockage in the system (clot, air bubble, etc), loose connections, kinks in the tubing, arterial spasm, too narrow tubing Underdamping leads to overestimated systolic and underestimated diastolic pressure (tendency away from the mean) die to catheter whip or artefact, stiff tubing, hypothermia, tachycardia or dysrhythmia References Normal arterial line waveforms | Deranged Physiology and Interpretation of abnormal arterial line waveforms | Deranged Physiology Pressure Transducers And Arterial Line Waveforms - RK.md Lamia B, Chemla D, Richard C, Teboul JL.

Upon analysis of the data, the primary outcome, fatal coronary artery disease or nonfatal MI at 6 years, was similar among all groups. There was also no significant difference in all-cause mortality, a secondary outcome, among the groups. - When comparing amlodipine with chlorthalidone, the amlodipine group had a 38% higher risk of heart failure (HF) (P<.001) and a 35% higher risk of hospitalized/fatal HF (P<.001). - When comparing lisinopril with chlorthalidone, the lisinopril group had a 15% higher risk for stroke (P=.02), a 10% higher risk of combined cardiovascular disease (CVD) (p<0.001), a 19% higher risk of HF (P<.001), and an 11% higher risk of hospitalized/treated angina (P=.01).

One of the leading causes of heart failure (HF), DCM predominantly affects younger adults and is the most frequent indication for cardiac transplantation. DCM can be classified as: 1) Genetic / familial 2) Nongenetic / mixed or acquired / nonfamilial Etiology Diverse set of etiologies (and therefore, pathogenesis) of DCM. Idiopathic and familial diseases are the most common. Advances in genetic diagnostics are unveiling etiologies that would previously be classified as idiopathic. - Genetic mutations (most common) - Infection (most common -- 30%). Typically associated with myocarditis. - Viruses, particularly the enteroviruses.

Doxorubicin: cumulative, dose-related, progressive myocardial damage. Doxorubicin binds both DNA and type II topoisomerase, leading to DNA double-stranded breaks and transcriptome changes resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species generation and cardiac cell death. - Metabolic and endocrine dysfunction : Cushing, thyroid, pheochromocytoma, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, inborn errors of metabolism, thiamine and selenium deficiency, carnitine deficiency - Neuromuscular disease : muscular and myotonic dystrophies, Friedreich ataxia - Pregnancy and peripartum cardiomyopathy DCM Genetics several genes have been implicated in the development of DCM when mutated. Interrelationship between genes and environment is minimally studied; EtOH exposure facilitates the development of DCM in individuals with rare variants of DCM-associated genes familial DCM is defined when 2 closely related (1st/2nd degree) family members meet diagnostic criteria for idiopathic DCM. 15-30% of patients with DCM may be diagnosed with familial DCM if we screen their family members. Although a genetic basis for familial DCM is well established, most cases of DCM seem to be sporadic.

Epidemiology In a 2013 review, the prevalence of DCM was estimated to be >1 per 250 individuals on the basis of recent clinical trial and related data; this result is particularly relevant as reliable population-based studies of the prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have estimated it to be at least 1 per 500 individuals, and the review article estimates that DCM is at least as common in the population as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Risk Factors 30% higher risk in Black than White individuals (not fully explained by hypertension or socioeconomic factors) men > women by ~3:1 Mechanisms and Pathophysiology Animal models have demonstrated that LV dilatation results from remodelling and fibrosis. Similarly, in patients with DCM, there is evidence of scar tissue, with the left ventricle assuming a spherical shape. Pathophysiological changes include a decrease in stroke volume (blood volume pumped by the left ventricle at each contraction) and cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped by the heart per minute), impaired ventricular filling and an increase in end-diastolic pressure (the amount of blood in the ventricle when relaxed, which is a measure of dilation). Compensatory changes in the vascular system include an increase in systemic vascular resistance, a decrease in arterial compliance and an increase in venous pressure and circulating blood volume. Both cardiac preload (stretching of the heart wall before contraction) and afterload (the force needed for contraction to eject blood from the heart) are increased, with increased afterload resulting in elevated wall stress. Diastole involves both active relaxation (early diastole) and passive compliance (mid-to-late diastole). In DCM, diastolic dysfunction that affects both components can accompany a reduction in systolic function. Impaired ventricular relaxation results in reduced rapid ventricular filling. Clinical Diagnosis of DCM Clinical Heart Failure The clinical presentation of DCM is generally unrelated to the underlying aetiology and ranges from dyspnoea, swollen legs, ankles and stomach, fatigue and chest pain caused by reduced oxygen levels reaching the heart to arrhythmia, acute decompensation or cardiogenic shock. The signs and symptoms of DCM mainly relate to the degree of LV or biventricular systolic dysfunction leading to pump failure; heart failure signs and symptoms may be fulminant, acute, subacute or chronic. In addition, atypical chest pain and palpitation may be present. Evaluation of DCM Echocardiography Echocardiographic definition of DCM: 1) LV EDV/EDD > 2 SD from normal 2) LVEF < 45-50% Rule out: - coronary artery disease (?cardiac cath, CCTA ) Electrocardiography and Holter ECG can be normal, but patients can have isolated T wave changes, LBBB, IVCD. ST and SVT are common; 20-30% of patients have NSVT. Genetic and Family Screening Idiopathic DCM --> consider a genetic etiology. The basic evaluation of these patients should include a detailed family history as well as clinical screening of first-degree relatives. Next-generation sequencing methods, such as whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing, are emerging as moderately inexpensive approaches for diagnosis that have both clinical and research implications. Even in the absence of an identified pathogenetic mutation, first-degree relatives should have periodic ECG and echocardiography to detect early signs of DCM. Cardiac MRI Cardiac MRI is the the best method for morphological and functional evaluation and characterization of myocardial tissue in patients with DCM. Consider for patients with ?inflammation or fibrotic etiology. - The presence of myocardial fibrosis can be detected with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). - MRI detects myocardial oedema suggestive of acute myocarditis or sarcoidosis - low sensitivity tool In DCM, the degree of fibrosis, marked by delayed gadolinium enhancement, is a predictor of all-cause mortality and need for future hospitalization. 33 Specifically, delayed enhancement is associated with increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. 34 \u2013 36 Delayed enhancement may also reflect features beyond fibrosis, including edema and inflammatory infiltrate. 37 FGD-PET FDG-PET is emergic as a valuable tool for the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis. EMB The current expert consensus statement of the ESC recommends that all patients with suspected inflammatory cardiomyopathy should undergo an EMB to identify the type of inflammatory infiltrate, to determine the underlying aetiology and form an aetiology-based treatment strategy. Several studies report that EMB can be performed with a very low rate of major complications and that LV biopsy is as safe as right ventricular biopsy. Tissue obtained from EMB should be analysed using histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology techniques. Management of DCM aims are to reduce HF symptoms and to improve cardiac function General Management of HF +/- rEF management is mostly NOT based primarily on DCM alone, but on evidence-base strategies to manage HFrEF. The pivotal randomized controlled clinical trials that provided the evidence for the guidelines on the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction included a large proportion of patients with a non-ischaemic aetiology (that is, individuals who probably developed heart failure as a result of DCM). Consequently, on the basis of subgroup analyses, it is reasonable to assume that the efficacy and safety of most treatments for heart failure extend to patients with DCM. See GDMT Etiology-Based Therapies For patients with EMB-confirmed myocarditis or infection-associated DCM. - consider immunosuppression in virus-negative EMB proven myocarditis - consider antiviral therapies (IFN etc) with virus-positive EMB myocarditis. Enterovirus and adenovirus associated CM were shown to have benefit with IFN beta than placebo. - small studies have shown that immunoadsorption (removal of circulating autoAbs) improves cardiac function in these patients. Experimental therapy. Device Therapy CRT is indicated for patients with heart failure and LVEF \u226435% who have a life expectancy with good functional status of >1 year if they are in sinus rhythm and have a markedly prolonged QRS duration (\u2265130 ms) and an ECG that shows left bundle branch block, irrespective of symptom severity. The benefits of CRT for patients with right bundle branch block or interventricular conduction delay are unclear (subgroup analyses suggest little benefit or even harm An updated meta-analysis of six randomized trials, assessing the effect of ICD on all-cause mortality in 2,970 patients with non-ischaemic DCM who were randomized to ICD or to optimal medical therapy for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death, found a significant 23% risk reduction in all-cause mortality in the ICD arm Surgical Therapy considered for failure of adequate management to pharmacologic and device therapy. In this setting, surgical options are considered: heart transplantation long-term MCS implantation +/- valve corrections Outcomes Most causes of heart failure from DCM result from pump failure (70%), and SCD accounts for 30% of outcomes. The effect of medications, ventricular devices and heart transplantation on the natural history of DCM is not well characterized, and despite advances in the management of heart failure in patients with DCM, there is still substantial mortality. Sudden cardiac death in DCM can be caused by electromechanical dissociation (pulseless electrical activity) or ventricular arrhythmias. The development of new LV branch block during follow-up is a strong independent prognostic predictor of all-cause mortality, and atrial fibrillation is a sign of structural disease progression and negatively affects the prognosis. Patients with DCM and haemodynamically relevant mitral regurgitation may need invasive therapies, such as percutaneous or open repair of the mitral valve, mechanical circulatory support or even heart transplantation. Whereas right ventricular function frequently recovers under therapy (typically within 6 months), the development of right ventricular dysfunction during long-term follow-up indicates structural disease progression and portends a negative outcome. Strategies to detect pre-symptomatic DCM have a clear rationale because early treatment can retard adverse remodelling, prevent heart failure symptoms and increase life expectancy. In addition, patients with DCM should be regularly re-assessed, particularly in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. Worsening of LV function or an increased ventricular arrhythmic burden can be caused not only by DCM progression but also by the development of new co-pathologies. Thus, the possible presence of coronary artery disease, hypertensive heart disease, structural valve disease or acute myocarditis should be systematically ruled out during follow-up. However, clinical and echocardiographical parameters have limited ability to predict long-term prognosis, suggesting that other host\u2013environmental factors are important in determining the outcome of DCM.

However, clinical and echocardiographical parameters have limited ability to predict long-term prognosis, suggesting that other host\u2013environmental factors are important in determining the outcome of DCM.","title":"Outcomes"},{"location":"Cardiology/Heart%20Failure/Dilated%20Cardiomyopathy/#references","text":"Braunwald\u2019s Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine , 52, 1031-1051 Dilated cardiomyopathy | Nature Reviews Disease Primers Dilated Cardiomyopathy | Circulation Research The Diagnosis and Evaluation of Dilated Cardiomyopathy | Journal of the American College of Cardiology Current Diagnostic and Treatment Strategies for Specific Dilated Cardiomyopathies: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association | Circulation","title":"References"},{"location":"Cardiology/Heart%20Failure/Guideline-Directed%20Medical%20Therapy/","text":"RAAS Inhibition Beta-Blockade Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonism SGLT2 Inhibition Second-Line GDMT ISDN Vericiguat https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-019-0084-1/tables/2","title":"RAAS Inhibition"},{"location":"Cardiology/Heart%20Failure/Guideline-Directed%20Medical%20Therapy/#raas-inhibition","text":"","title":"RAAS Inhibition"},{"location":"Cardiology/Heart%20Failure/Guideline-Directed%20Medical%20Therapy/#beta-blockade","text":"","title":"Beta-Blockade"},{"location":"Cardiology/Heart%20Failure/Guideline-Directed%20Medical%20Therapy/#mineralocorticoid-receptor-antagonism","text":"","title":"Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonism"},{"location":"Cardiology/Heart%20Failure/Guideline-Directed%20Medical%20Therapy/#sglt2-inhibition","text":"","title":"SGLT2 Inhibition"},{"location":"Cardiology/Heart%20Failure/Guideline-Directed%20Medical%20Therapy/#second-line-gdmt","text":"","title":"Second-Line GDMT"},{"location":"Cardiology/Heart%20Failure/Guideline-Directed%20Medical%20Therapy/#isdn","text":"","title":"ISDN"},{"location":"Cardiology/Heart%20Failure/Guideline-Directed%20Medical%20Therapy/#vericiguat","text":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-019-0084-1/tables/2","title":"Vericiguat"},{"location":"Cardiology/Heart%20Failure/HFrEF%20Drug%20Doses/","text":"Evidence based medications and doses for Guideline directed Medical Therapy in the treatment of heart failure. 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure | European Heart Journal | Oxford Academic (mcmaster.ca) Agent Starting dose Target Dose ACE-I Captopril 6.25 mg t.i.d. 50 mg t.i.d.

Circulation. 2018;137(20):e578-e622. doi:10.1161/CIR.0000000000000560 Background Right ventricular (RV) failure occurs when the RV fails to maintain enough blood flow through the pulmonary circulation to achieve adequate left ventricular filling. Normal Pulmonary Circulation and RV Pulmonary Circuit the pulmonary circuit is normally a low pressure circuit. Even with exertion, pulmonary pressures increase minimally and PVR falls despite rises in cardiac output. This difference is due to the ability of the lungs to recruit underutilized vessels as CO increases in the pulmonary circuit, the arterial/venous mean pressure gradient is typically less than 10 mmHg (small) the pulmonary circuit has LOW vascular tone, making it resistant to alterations from systemically-active vasoactive medications (vasodilators, catecholamines) RV thin walled (2-3 mm), able to produce less contractile force. Has a greated EDV and SA per unit of blood, and the RV achieves a similar SV as the LV with lower energy expenditure muscle fibers are arranged longitudinally: the apex will contract towards the TV does not handle increases in afterload well: this sharply decreases contractility as compared to the LV process of interventricular dependence (with RV enlargement) leads to reduced LV filling which is typically refractory/paradoxically responsive to volume expansion Causes Acute RHF Pulmonary embolism Right-sided myocardial infarction Acute on chronic RHF Chronic RHF Cor pulmonale (Pulmonary hypertension) Evaluation of RV Function in Critical Illness physical examination RV filling pressure elevation: JVD, peripheral edema S2 splitting TR murmur RV heave Echocardiogram RV systolic function tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) measures the longitudinal systolic displacement of the RV base toward the RV apex Correlates well with RV ejection fraction Normal TAPSE = 2.4 to 2.7 cm. Less than 1.8 cm has an 87% accuracy at predicting SVI < 29 ml/m2 Associated with poorer prognosis in RHF and PAH Estimates of RV systolic pressure obtained by echocardiogram correlate well with measurements made by right heart catheterization, but the variance between measures can be greater than 10 mm Hg in up to 50% of cases. Particularly poor in patients with chronic lung disease as well as those with positive pressure ventilation. LV dysfunction Valvular disease RHC When reliable measurement of pulmonary hemodynamics is needed, pulmonary artery catheterization provides valuable information on RV and LV filling pressures, cardiac output, and pulmonary artery pressure Management Causes of RV failure in critical illness can be divided into three main categories: ( 1 ) excessive preload; ( 2 ) excessive afterload; and ( 3 ) insufficient myocardial contractility. Management is directed at addressing these three factors. RV Preload fluid management is critical: fluid volume - hypovolemic, bleeding, third-spacing, insensible losses venous return - systemic vascular tone, vasodilatation vs vasoconstriction states, positive pressure ventilation the goal preload should be to keep RV transmural filling pressures in a moderately elevated range (8-12 mmHg) and adjust from there to optimize CO. The RV has a flatter Starling curve, meaning that greater changes in volume are required to impact contractility than the LV . RV preload may need to be increased or decreased , generally depending on the afterload: high afterload (pulmonary hypertension etc): volume loading can lead to interventricular dependence and impaired LV diastolic filling, increased RV myocardial demands. --> decrease RV volume (diuresis, ultrafiltration) low afterload (RV infarction etc): RV EDP needs to be increased above normal to maintain CO --> increase RV volume (fluids) It may be useful to monitor SvO2 (normal 70-80%) and CVP to guide management, and even consider Swan-Ganz placement for better hemodynamic assessment RV Afterload excessive afterload is implicated in almost all acute RHF, and addressing this is usually the most effective management strategy. focus on reversible factors (i.e. not chronic cardiopulmonary conditions that are irreversible): hypoxic vasoconstriction alveolar hypoxia pulmonary arterial hypoxemia hypercapnea acidemia excessive high or low lung volumes sepsis and endothelial dysfunction pulmonary thrombosis if needed, consider pulmonary vasodilators : inhaled NO inhaled epoprostenol PDE-5 inhibitors: sildenafil, tadalafil RV Contractility decreased contractility in acute RHF is due to (1) overstretch of myocytes (2) cellular metabolic derangement (3) perfusion-demand mismatch. Address these issues first (1) overstretch - optimize preload (2) metabolic derangement - fix reversible systemic issues (3) RV perfusion - fix systemic hypotension (to optimize coronary perfusion pressure) particularly diastolic hypotension, reduce RV wall tension if that fails, then consider: vasopressors : NE often the vasopressor of choice due to limited B1 inotropy and positive effects on RV oxygen delivery. Low-dose vasopressin reasonable as well due to pulmonary vasodilatory effect (0.01 to 0.03 U/min) inotropes : low-dose dopamine, milrinone (less chronotropic effect), or dobutamine are all reasonable choices if that fails then consider: mechanical support - ECLS has been used in RV failure as a bridge to endarterectomy, lung transplant.

Overall, CCTA decreased coronary death or nonfatal MI at 5 years (2.3% vs 3.9%), and increased preventative therapies (19.4% vs 14.7%). Increased early coronary angiography. Lower delayed angiography. No significant differences in rates of long-term coronary angiography or coronary revascularization. Median followup 5 years. [Link to study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30145934/ Likely driven by earlier + targeted revascularization if needed Not driven by long-term increased revascularization. Likely also driven by earlier initiation of preventative management (ASA/statin), and higher sensitivity to nonobstructive CAD. J\u00f8rgensen et al (JACC 2017) evaluated retrospectively 87,000 stable patients undergoing initial noninvasive cardiac testing with CCTA or functional testing (exercise ECG, nuclear stress test). Overall finding was that CCTA was greater use of statins, aspirin, and invasive procedures, and higher costs than functional testing (within 120 days only ). Coronary CTA was associated with a lower risk of MI , but a similar risk of all-cause mortality. Link to study DISCHARGE (NEJM 2022) compared CCTA with invasive angiography for initial diagnostic strategy in patients with stable chest pain with intermediate pretest probability of obstructive CAD who were referred for invasive angiography. This approach had no significant effect on MACE (over 3.5 years) or anginal symptoms, but did show a lower risk of major procedure-related complications and revascularization procedures.

Pro-inflammatory cytokine action, Recruitment of leukocytes, Hyaline membrane formation from protein deposition. Vascular obliteration from microthrombi etc. leads to dead space and pulmonary hypertension and hypercapnia. Classically affects dependent areas of the lung. Decreased lung compliance --> shunting --> hypoxemia --> work of breathing --> SOB. Clinically: First 7 days of illness after exposure to ARDS risk factor. Symptoms usually develop within 1.5 days, but can be delayed up to a 1 week. Presents with SOB, +WOB. Nonspecific laboratory values. CXR --> pulmonary edema, usually at least 3/4 of lung fields.

Minimizing Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury Key Trial ARDSNet changed practice towards low-volume and low-pressure ventilation. Injury can arise from \"volutrauma\", \"atelectrauma\" which lead to inflammation and alveolar injury. Low VT ventilation (6 mL/kg PBW) and low airway pressures (Pplateau < 30 cm H2O) were shown in ARDSNet to reduce mortality by 40%, and these strategies are now commonly used. Optimize PEEP Reduced compliance means that end-expiration alveolar collase can occur without increases in end-expiratory pressures. Increase PEEP to minimize FiO2 and optimize PaO2 , there is no consensus on how to do this. Methods include: ARDSNet tables of PEEP-FiO2 combinations generating a static pressure-volume curve for the respiratory system and setting PEEP at the lower inflection point on this curve to maximize respiratory system compliance Prone Positioning PROSEVA (2013) In severe ARDS (PF < 150), early prolonged proned positioning decreases 28 and 90 day mortality by 60% and by 56% respectively as compared to semirecumbent \"supine\" positioning. Earlier studies show this also improves arterial oxygenation (PaO2) Other Strategies in Mechanical Ventilation Recruitment maneuvers can increase PEEP and oxygenation but have not been shown to reduce mortality. ART trial (2017) PHARLAP (2019) Alternate ventilation modes such as APRV and HFOV have not proven beneficial ECMO improves mortality and may serve as rescue therapy. Steroids in ARDS Based on the 2017 and 2019 guidelines for ARDS, few studies have shown significant mortality benefit. They not support the routine use of glucocorticoids in ARDS. However, in 2020 the ARDSNet group published the first dexamethasone trial of ARDS, the DEXA-ARDS trial, in the Lancet. This study showed that in early moderate to severe ARDS (PF < 200), ten days of dexamethasone (20 mg for five days then 10 mg for five days) in addition to lung-protective ventilation decreased 60-day mortality by 15% absolute difference (21% vs 36%), increased ventilator-free days at 28 days by 4.8 days. Less proning was needed for dexamethasone arm. There were no significant adverse effects compared to control with respect to hyperglycemia, new infections in the ICU, or barotrauma. N=277, and this trial wssas stopped early for efficacy. DEXA-ARDS In moderate to severe ARDS, 10 days of dexamethasone reduces mortality by 15% absolute risk (NNT = 6), and increases ventilator-free days within 28 days by 5 days on average. Oxygen Targets in ARDS LOCO2 In the LOCO2 trial (NEJM 2020), a conservative oxygen target may have increased mortality compared to a liberal oxygen target for patients with ARDS. Based on the results of this trial, and ICU-ROX (NEJM 2020), suggest a liberal SpO2 target > 96% . LOCO2 At day 28, a total of 34 of 99 patients (34.3%) in the conservative-oxygen group and 27 of 102 patients (26.5%) in the liberal-oxygen group had died (difference, 7.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u22124.8 to 20.6). Among patients with ARDS, early exposure to a conservative-oxygenation strategy with a Pao2 between 55 and 70 mm Hg did not increase survival at 28 days Given the results of the LOCO2 trial, the lower range of the Spo2 target in any conservative strategy, especially in patients requiring a high level of Fio2, should perhaps be 90%, as was used in ICU-ROX, rather than 88%. Fluid Management in ARDS Propensity to have increased interstitial and alveolar protein-rich fluid that worsens inflammation and oxygenation. Maintain low left atrial filling pressure to minimize pulmonary edema, preserve oxygenation and lung compliance, improve pulmonary mechanics, shorten ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation The FACTT trial (\"Comparison of Two Fluid-Management Strategies in Acute Lung Injury\") suggests that conservative fluid management (i.e., net-neutral) compared to liberal-strategy (+ 1 litre per day on average) improves lung functional and shortens mechanical ventilation and critical care, without increasing non-pulmonary organ failure. The 2006 Fluids and Catheters Treatment Trial (FACTT) sought to define the optimal fluid management strategy in ALI/ARDS. It randomized 1,000 patients with ALI/ARDS to liberal (CVP 10-14) or conservative (CVP <4) fluid management strategies. At 60 days, there was no difference between the two groups in mortality. However, the conservative therapy was associated with a decreased days on a ventilator and time in the ICU. Fluid restriction Diuretics Limited only by hypotension and end-organ hypoperfusion Neuromuscular Blockade in ARDS See Neuromuscular Blockade . In severe ARDS, sedation alone can be inadequate for the patient-ventilator synchrony required for lung-protective ventilation. ACURASYS (2010) showed a mortality and ventilation-dependence benefit with 48h of cisatracurium in severe ARDS. ROSE (2019) demonstrated that this approach in conjunction with modern light sedation protocols did not reduce mortality, and was associated with an increase in ICU-acquired weakness and serious adverse cardiovascular events. Therefore, do not routinely use Neuromuscular Blockade for severe ARDS. Other Therapies Pulmonary surfactants not shown to work. Pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled NO, not shown to work.

In summary, haloperidol is not shown to have meaningful effects on ICU/hospital LOS, mortality (except for AID-ICU 2022) in the prevention or treatment of hypoactive and hyperactive delirious ICU patients. No trials have closely looked at the symptoms of delirium (distress, agitation, safety of patient care) . No significant signal of harm including EPS or arrhythmia from QTc elongation. In accordance with most recent PADIS (2018) guidelines, routine use of haloperidol does not meaningfully impact LOS. Unclear whether it facilitates patient care and safety. HOPE-ICU (Lancet 2014) In critically ill patients does early treatment with haloperidol decrease the time that survivors spend in delirium or coma? Methods (Summary) Double-blind, placebo controlled RCT. Single-centre in general adult ICU in the UK. N=142 Population: mechanically ventilated patients on PPF/FENT infusions for sedation with target RASS 0 to -1. Could also be treated dwith open-label haloperidol IV, up to 10 mg/day for RASS 2+ or above (all arms) Intervention: Haloperidol 2.5 mg q8H scheduled Control: placebo Outcomes: Number of delirium-free, and coma-free days in 1st 14 days Results No significant difference of days free of coma or delirium at 14 days. No significant differences in any mortality, LOS outcomes. No differences in complications including oversedation, QTc > 500 ms, or EPS. Trend towards lower sedative/analgesic use, and RASS >1 Takeaway The use of early regular haloperidol did not prevent patients developing delirium. It did reduce agitation and there was a trend towards decreased use of sedatives and analgesics when haloperidol was given. Other studies will need to tell us if haloperidol is a useful treatment once delirium has developed. MIND-USA (NEJM 2018) In delirious adult ICU patients, does the administration of haloperidol or ziprasidone reduce the duration of delirium when compared with placebo? Population N=566 adult ICU patients with acute respiratory failure or shock (NOT clear why others were excluded), delirium (hyperactive or hypoactive; CAM-ICU positive) 16 centres in the USA exclusion: QTc > 550 ms, Hx NMS, outpatient antipsychotic or lithium treatment, severe baseline cognitive impairment Intervention and Control Interventions: IV haloperidol (2.5 mg if younger than 70, 1.25 mg if older than 70), up to 10 mg per administration and 20 mg per day; OR IV ziprasidone. Control: IV placebo Schedule: Q12H, dosages were doubled if the patient was still delirious. If the patient was not delirious on two consecutive CAM-ICU assessments then the dosages were halved. Measures days alive without delirium or coma duration of delirium, time to liberation from ventilation, time to successful ICU discharge, time to hospital discharge, 30-day and 90-day survival safety end-points: TdP, NMS, EPS Results No statistical difference in the adjusted median number of days alive and without coma No statistical difference in 30- and 90-day mortality, liberation from ventilation, LOS for ICU and hospital Safety: LQTS more common in ziprasidoe than in haloperidol or placebo group.

Element Bundle A Assess, Prevent, and Manage Pain B Both SAT and SBTs C Choice of analgesia and sedation D Delirium: assess, prevent, manage E Early mobility and exercise F Family engagement and empowerment Pain Critically ill patients experience moderate to severe pain at rest and during standard care procedures. Severe pain negatively affects patient status (vitals, immunosuppression), and standardized pain management protocols improve ICU outomes. - self-reported pain is the reference statndard - in patients unable to report pain, and in whom behaviours are observable, the Behavioural Pain Scale in intubated (BPS) and nonintubated (BPS-NI) patients and the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) demonstrate the greatest validity and reliability for monitoring pain - involve family as well for pain assessment - physiologic measures of pain - vital signs are NOT valid indicators; use as cues to initiate further assessment using validated tools Pharmacologic adjuvants to opioid therapy acetaminophen - use as adjuvant. IV acetaminophen may cause hypotension nefopam - use as adjunct or opioid replacement (not avail in USA/Canada) ketamine - use low-dose ketamine (push and infusion) as adjunct to opioids particularly in postsurgical adults neuropathic pain meds (gabapentin, pregabalin, CBZ) should be used for neuropathic pain management lidocaine - do not routinely use IV lidocaine COX-1 inhibitors - do not routinely use COX-1 NSAIDs as adjunct for pain, mainly due to risk of adverse effects Pharmacologic interventions to reduce procedural pain (regular activities, discrete procedures) assess and treat pain before the procedure (i.e. pre-emptive) use an opioid at the lowest effective dose (fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, remifentanil, etc) suggest not using either local analgesia or nitrous oxide for pain management (disagree...) do not use inhaled volatile anesthetic for procedural pain management suggest using NSAID as alternative to opioid for procedural pain management (orall, IV, rectally, not topically) Nonpharm methods consider massage, music therapy, cold therapy, relaxation techniques Agitation and Sedation 2013 guidelines suggest (1) targeting light levels of sedation or daily awakening trials (2) minimizing benzos. Light sedation recommended over deep sedation (shortened time to extubation, reduced ICU LOS) light sedation was defined in 2013 PAD guidelines as RASS >= -2 and eye opening of at least 10 minutes. This is probably deeper than required to management of vented patients in the ICU no universal definition of light sedation daily sedative interruptions and nurse-protocolized sedation can achieve and maintain light sedation choice of sedative 2013 PAD guidelines: non-benzo sedatives (propofol, dexmedetomidine) preferred to benzos (midazolam, lorazepam) due to better LOS, mech vent, delirium outcomes. cardiac surgery patients propofol recommended over benzos non-cardiac surgery patients propofol or dexmedetomidine preferred over benzos dex possibly better than propofol (PRODEX study) physical restraints commonly used, little evidence may paradoxically increase risk of unplanned extubations, reintubations, device removal, agitation, benzo dose Delirium Background risk factors for delirium in the ICU modifiable benzo use blood transfusion non-modifiable age, dementia proir coma pre-ICU emergency surgery or trauma sickness (ASA, APACHE scores) screen for delirium using CAM-ICU or ICDSC level of arousal influences delirium assessment particularly below RASS -3 Delirium is associated with cognitive impairment long term, longer hospital LOS.

These medications decrease delirium, but not other clinically relevant outcomes. pharmacologic treatment of ICU-delirium Consider haloperidol (not per guidelines).

The Awake and Breathing Controlled trial (ABC) showed that daily spontaneous awakening trial + SBT (SAT/SBT) resulted in more days breathing without assistance, shorter ICU length of stay, shorter hospital length of stay, and lower mortality than standard of care. Assessing SBT Success adequate oxygenation adequate ventilation no signs of severe fatigue accessory muscle use, diaphoresis high RSBI (Yang-Tobin study) > 105 no other obvious complications from SBT (arrhythmia, bradycardia, hypotension, severe hypertension) Duration, and T-piece vs PSV? no differences in the rate of successful extubation between 2-hour PSV and 2-hour T-piece ventilation, between T-piece ventilation for 30 minutes vs 2 hours, or between PSV for 30 minutes vs 2 hours Subira et. al (JAMA 2019) randomized 1153 adults at low-risk of re- intubation to SBTs with 30 minutes of PSV (8/0 cm H2O) versus 2 hours of T-piece ventilation. 82.3% vs 74% of patients were successfully extubated (remained free of mechanical ventilation 72 hours after first SBT), p=0.001. Re- intubation rates were the same, and there were no significant differences in ICU or hospital LOS. Hospital mortality was lower (10.4% vs 14.9% in-hospital, p=0.02) CHEST 2020 analysis showed that PSV (7/0) vs T-piece led to successful extubation in 67% vs 56% (p<0.01) of patients at high risk of re- intubation CCM 2020 meta-analysis of 10 RCTs showed that there was no significant difference in the successful extubation rate or rate of reintubation between the T-piece group and PSV group. The pressure used in these studies varied from 5-18cm H2O and the PEEP varied from 0-8cm H2O, which is highly variable. Na et al. (Resp Res 2022) examined PSV (8/0) vs T-piece and found no association of PSV with a higher rate of successful weaning compared with SBT using T-piece latest American Thoracic Society guidelines for weaning recommend PSV spontaneous breathing trials instead of T-piece with moderate-quality evidence SUMMARY With the current evidence, consider using shorter (30 minutes) and less demanding (PSV 8/0) SBTs. This may lead to higher rates of extubation and lower mortality Address Potential Cuff Leak Extubation to Respiratory Support After a successful SBT and extubation, 10% to 25% of patients require reintubation, and reintubation is associated with higher mortality.

In support modes, the patient initiates the breath but the work is partially offset. inspiratory breath characteristics trigger - what is the variable the initiates the breath? Time (ventilator-triggered) or flow or pressure change (patient-triggered). limit/target - the pressure, volume, or flow target during inspiration. cycle - the variable the ends the inspiratory phase and signals the start of passive expiratory gas flow. This can be time, tidal volume, or decrease in flow to a percentage of the peak inspiratory flow. Controlled Modes Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV) Pressure limited and time-cycled. Tidal volume is the dependent variable and changes based on the mechanics. Target pressure is achieved and flow then decelerates to maintain a constant pressure profile for the inspiratory time. Volume Control Ventilation (VCV) Volume limited and time-cycled. Predetermined tidal volume at set respiratory rate. Flow is usually a square waveform but can be decelerating or sinusoidal. Peak inspiratory flow or inspiratory time is set and determines the duration of inspiration. Guarantees minute ventilation; airway presures can vary based on the mechanics of the respiratory system. High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) Constant distending pressure (mean airway pressure MAP) is generated. Active inspiration and expiration with very small tidal volumes at 3-10 Hz (180 to 600 breaths per minute). Not been shown to improve mortality in ARDS with this lung-protective strategy. Assist Modes Assist Control Ventilation (ACV) Etiher pressure or volume-limited. Essentially this is PCV or VCV except the patient may trigger the ventilator for any or all breaths. The breaths are delivered according to the pressure/volume settings. Guarantees a minimum number of breaths (i.e. there is a set back-up RR), and if the patient is not breathing this is indistinguishable from PCV or VCV. Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) Similar to ACV, but in SIMV the patient is allowed to take unsupported breaths in between mandatory patient-triggered (or time-triggered) breaths. In the absence of additional PSV (see diagram below) or spontaneous breathing (e.g. in a fully sedated or paralyzed patient), this mode is essentially identical to ACV. Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) Pressure limited and flow-cycled. Patient determines the respiratory rate and each breath is patient-triggered. Patient effort triggers gas flow increase until the pressure support level is reached. When inspiratory flow decreaes below a threshold, then the ventilator cycles to expiration. Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) This is a time-cycled mode that alternates between two levels of airway pressure (Phigh and Plow). Most time is spent at Phigh to maintain alveolar recruitment, with brief cycling (<1 second) to Plow to allow for ventilation. The patient is meant to breath throughout the respiratory cycle (superimposed). Lung-Protective Ventilation in ALI/ARDS Ventilation can cause various mechanisms of lung trauma (1) barotrauma (2) volutrauma (3) atelectrauma (4) biotrauma which overall are termed \"ventilator induced lung injury\" (VILI). A lung-protective strategy aims to limit lung stress and strain (tidal voolumes, plateau pressures), and maintain PEEP to keep the lung recruited and to minimize atelectrauma. Low tidal-volume ventilation Generally used and proven in ARDS - see ARDSNet trial. May result in hypercapnia (can usually tolerate this in a permissive hypercapnic strategy ). Optimize PEEP The optimal level of PEEP as part of a lung-protective strategy in ARDS is not definitely established. The ALVEOLI, LOVS, and Express trials failed to demonstrate a significant mortality benefit with higher PEEP, but higher PEEP patients overall required fewer rescue interventions for refractory hypoxemia. In meta-analysis, patients with ARDS at baseline (PF < 200) and higher PEEP were more likely to survive to hospital discharge. HFOV The OSCAR and OSCILLATE trials studied HFOV in ARDS - overall no mortality benefit in OSCAR, and actually showed increased mortality in OSCILLATE. References Ligori T.

Managing complications of pleural procedures. Journal of Thoracic Disease . 2021;13(8). doi: 10.21037/jtd-2019-ipicu-04 Anatomic Review The major relevant structures include the chest wall, ribs, intercostal neurovascular bundle (consisting of an intercostal vein, artery, and nerve), heart, lungs, diaphragm, and subdiaphragmatic organs. Neurovascular Bundle The intercostal neurovascular bundle tracks along the inferior margin of the associated rib and injury to this bundle can increase the risk of bleeding and pain. In light of this anatomical relationship, access to the pleural space is typically approached over the superior rib margin. It should be noted that this vessel-to-rib relationship is less reliable along the posterior and medial aspect of the ribs. Example of tortuosa ICA in an elderly man: Triangle of Safety This is the preferred area of entry when not using ultrasound or when not limited by a loculated effusion or apical pneumothorax. Notably, the left oblique fissure passes through the triangle of safety, which leads to the risk of chest tube placement within the fissure. The \u2018triangle of safety\u2019 is bordered by: 1) superior aspect of the fifth rib inferiorly 2) the lateral edge of latissimus dorsi posteriorly 3) the lateral edge of pectoralis major anteriorly This area is best accessed in the following positions: 1) lying in the lateral decubitus position 2) sitting upright and leaning forward with arms raised 3) lying in the semi-recumbent position with the arm raised above the head Ultrasound Now routinely recommended. In one study comparing ultrasound to physical exam in selecting the appropriate puncture site, ultrasound prevented organ puncture in 10% of overall cases and increased the accuracy of the puncture site by 26%. Complications Pneumothorax Iatrogenic pneumothorax has been found in 0.3\u20131.5% of cases using ultrasound guidance and 5.7\u201315% without ultrasound. They develop via direct injury to the visceral pleural, via entrapment of air from the outside (through the catheter, incision site, etc.), or are ex vacuo. Management: - small and asymptomatic; observation and oxygen - symptomatic or large (>2 cm) or expanding; tube thoracostomy (small bore preferred) Re-expansion pulmonary edema The true incidence of RPE is unknown with small case series and reviews reporting an incidence between 0.2% and 14%. RPE is suspected when a patient develops dyspnea, cough, and hypoxia in the minutes to hours following pleural aspiration. However, it can occur anytime within the first 24 hours. - Management: conservative supportive treatment. - Prevention: expert opinion has historically recommended terminating pleural fluid drainage at 1 or 1.5 L if pleural pressures are not being monitored. However, RPE may occur independent of the volume of fluid removed. Pain Pain is reported following thoracentesis in anywhere from 5\u201339% of patients. Due to: - re-expansional pain with a non-expandable lung - chemical pleurodesis - insertion site/chest tube pain Management: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been found to provide similar pain relief as opiates without increasing the risk of pleurodesis failure. Bleeding The risk of significant bleeding from pleural procedures is low. Bleeding may be arterial or venous and is often related to damage to the intercostal vessels. Bleeding is suspected in the post-procedure setting with the rapidly reaccumulating pleural fluid, which can be visualized sonographically or radiographically, or with the rapid onset of respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain. Prevention: avoid elective procedures for patients with therapeutic anticoagulation.

Available from: https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(16)62283-3/abstract Introduction RAP, or its surrogate CVP, is determined by the interaction between cardiac function and venous return function. Its dynamic observation can give us insight into right sided cardiac diastolic function tricuspid valve function volume responsiveness cardiac rhythm What determines RAP and CVP? RAP ~= CVP for central veins (not the femoral) and when there isn't constriction between the catheter and the RA. RAP is determined by the interaction of cardiac function and venous return: cardiac function (HR, preload, afterload, contractility) venous return (\"stretched\" vascular volume, venous compliance, venous resistance, downstream CVP). The heart effects venous return primarily by lowerig the RAP. the normal pressure difference from the upstream venous reservoir to the heart is only 4-8 mmHg, and small measurement errors can have important clinical consequences CVP Status Elevated: decreased cardiac function + normal or moderately elevated blood volume high venous return due to elevated blood volume decreased venous resistance without matching rise in cardiac function (e.g. distributive shock) Low/Zero Normal state hypovolemia increased venous resistance hyperdynamic cardiac function CVP, by itself, is not a useful marker of volume status, and in isolation is not a strong predictor of fluid responsiveness. Technicalities Methods JVP is a physical examination maneuver that estimates the CVP: Technique: measure the height of the venous distension above the sternal angle. On average, the midpoint of the RA is 5cm vertically below the sternal angle (regardless of sitting angle). Measure from the base of the pulsations seen, not the top. Conversion: measurement in cm H2O / 1.36 = mm Hg. For example, JVP of 10 cm above the RA estimates a RAP of 7 mmHg. CVC transduction can measure the CVP better by transducing a column. Ultrasound can measure the CVP by looking at the level of collapse in the jugular veins. Considerations for Catheter Transducing Pay attention to the three following issues: Zeroing - standard zero is atmospheric pressure. Open the transducer to air and zeroing it. It is approximately 760 mmg under standard conditions. Calibration - automated. Leveling - the transducer needs to be leveled to a physiologic reference point in order to make sense. 1) In studies, the point is the middle of the RA or the mid-TV and this is done by setting the transducer 5 cm below the sternal angle. 2) Realistically, the point is the mid-axillary line at the 4th ICS because no measuring device is required. This should only be used supine. 3) The difference between these methods is about 3 mm Hg and varies with chest size. Interpretation of Waveforms CVP waveforms have three pulsatile waves: 1) \"a wave\" - due to atrial contraction. Aligns with the cardiac P wave. 2) \"c wave\" - due to retrograde buckling of the TV with ventricular contraction and the abrupt interruption of blood flowing into the RA. Typically lines up with the S wave on cardiac leads. 3) \"v wave\" - due to the continued filling of the RA during ventricular systole","title":"Right Atrial Pressure in the Critically Ill"},{"location":"Critical%20Care/Procedures/Right%20Atrial%20Pressure%20in%20the%20Critically%20Ill/#right-atrial-pressure-in-the-critically-ill","text":"Magder S.

Succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg (e.g. 100 mg). Time to intubation level paralysis is 45-60 seconds with this dose, and effect last ~6 minutes. Procedural conscious sedation The approach here will depend upon (1) baseline sedation status (awake, sedated?), (2) procedure invasiveness and pain (chest tube, line, wound debridement), (3) hemodynamic and respiratory status. Importantly, the CAS practice guidelines state that it is unacceptable for a single physician to administer an anesthetic, including deep procedural sedation, and simultaneously perform a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure , except for procedures done with only infiltration of local anesthetic and/or minimal sedation.

Consider adjunct local or regional anesthesia in addition to sedation for particularly painful procedures. various combinations of medications can be used and should be short-acting and titratable, and be wary of medication synergism IV sedative/dissociative/hypnotic +/- IV short-acting opioid No CAS recommendations are made as to the specific medications to be used. In general, consider and be knowledgeable about how to use and rescue from the following medication choices: PPF Midazolam Fentanyl Ketamine PPF + Midazolam PPF + ketamine Midazolam + fentanyl (consider over PPF for longer procedures) Propofol Acts within 40 seconds, lasts 6 minutes. Sedative/amnestic without analgesia. Loading dose is 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg slow injection, with 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg q1-3 minutes PRN. For example, 25-50 mg IV then 25 mg IV q1-3 minutes PRN. Reduce dosing by 20-60% for older adults. The initial bolus should be maximum 0.5 mg/kg for these patients. Midazolam Acts within 2-5 minutes, lasts 30-60 minutes. Anxiolytic/amnestic without analgesia. 0.02 to 0.03 mg/kg. In adults, this is generally 0.5-1.0 mg per dose and titrated to effect q2-5 minutes. Fentanyl Acts within 2-3 minutes, and lasts 30 to 60 minutes. Pure analgesic without amnestic properties. When used in combination with a sedative for procedural sedation, dose is 0.5 mcg/kg (25-50 mcg) IV push boluses every 2 minutes until sedation/analgesia achieved. Ketamine Rapid onset, lasts 10-20 minutes. Sedation, analgesia, and amnesia with preserved CV status and respiratory tone and ventilation status. Avoid in schizophrenia. Dose is 1-2 mg/kg over 1-2 minutes then 0.25 to 1 mg/kg q5-10 minutes. For example, 100 mg IV loading then 25-50 mg increments afterwards. In combination with other agents, use the lower end of these doses. Emergence reactions (distressing disorientation, dreamlike experiences, or hallucinations) can be prevented with MDZ (1-2 mg) or haloperidol (5 mg) Pretreatment with ondasetron 4 mg x 1 can be useful for prevention of N/V (4% ) associated with ketamine (occurs while awake) Can lead to laryngospasm (rare).

No universal consensus definition of light sedation on the RASS exists, but generally in studies this corresponds to RASS -2 to +1 use daily sedative interruption (DSI) protocols (target RASS -1 to +1) and nursing-protocolized targeted sedation to maintain light sedation. choice of sedatives cardiac surgery patients - PPF preferred over benzodiazepine mechanically ventilated medical/surgical patients - PPF or DEX recommended over benzodiazepines (shorter time to extubation, higher risk of self-extubation, higher rates of asymptomatic bradycardia with DEX) Studies to know: PPF vs BZD - no landmark trial. DEX vs BZD - SEDCOM, MIDEX, MENDS PPF vs DEX - PRODEX, MENDS2 current evidence suggests that for light sedation, DEX = PPF for most general ICU patients. Be wary of bradycardia. For deep sedation, DEX monotherapy is likely not enough based on pharmacology/anecdotal evidence (but not examined in RCTs) Current Evidence Base MENDS2 (NEJM 2021) this multicentre (N=13) study randomized sedation for mechanically ventilated patients (N=422) with sepsis to either DEX or PPF based strategies with target RASS approx 0 to -2 overall, there was no difference in number of days alive without delirium or coma at 14 days, ventilator-free days, death at 90 days, or cognitive status at 6 months safety end points were similar betweeen DEX and PPF SUMMARY: Among mechanically ventilated adults with sepsis who were being treated with recommended light-sedation approaches, outcomes in patients who received dexmedetomidine did not differ from outcomes in those who received propofol.

Survival to hospital discharge and survival with favorable neurological outcome were not improved by amiodarone, but neither study was powered for those outcomes These randomized trials did not explore the timing or sequence of amiodarone versus epinephrine administration. No randomized trials were identified that address the use of amiodarone during in-hospital cardiac arrest. Lidocaine The recommended dose of lidocaine is 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg IV/IO for the first dose and 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg IV/IO for a second dose if required. Lidocaine in OHCA ROC-ALPS study --> ROSC higher with lidocaine compared to placebo and higher survival to hospital admission Lidocaine in IHCA No RCTs examine this question Lidocaine After ROSC Early studies in patients with acute myocardial infarction found that lidocaine suppressed premature ventricular complexes and nonsustained VT, rhythms that were believed to presage VF/pVT. Later studies noted a disconcerting association between lidocaine and higher mortality after acute myocardial infarction, possibly resulting from a higher incidence of asystole and bradyarrhythmias; thus, the routine practice of administering prophylactic lidocaine during acute myocardial infarction was abandoned. 21 , 22 One observational study with propensity-matched cohorts 23 found that lidocaine was not associated with increased survival when administered prophylactically after ROSC in adults with VF/pVT cardiac arrest, although it decreased the recurrence of VF/pVT. Thus, evidence supporting a potential role for prophylactic lidocaine after VF/pVT arrest is relatively weak, limited to short-term outcomes, and nonexistent for cardiac arrest presenting with nonshockable rhythms. Summary and Recommendations 1. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of lidocaine early (within the first hour) after ROSC. 2. In the absence of contraindications, the prophylactic use of lidocaine may be considered in specific circumstances (such as during emergency medical services transport) when treatment of recurrent VF/pVT might prove to be challenging (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C-LD). Personal Takeaway: After ROSC, if the patient is having recurrent episodes of VT that are worrisome for decompensation and inability to transport the patient to the ICU, then consider lidocaine administration. Otherwise no evidence to support its use. Amiodarone vs Lidocaine The ALIVE (NEJM 2002) trial showed that in shock resistant VF OHCA, 5 mg/kg amiodarone in polysorbate improved survival to hospital admission compared with 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine with polysorbate The ROC-ALPS trial for OHCA showed that ROSC was higher in patients receiving lidocaine compared with those receiving placebo but not for those receiving amiodarone compared with patients receiving placebo Summary: Evidence is mixed; use the first drug you can get your hands on.

Evidence Base DOREMI (NEJM 2021) Milrinone as Compared with Dobutamine in the Treatment of Cardiogenic Shock | NEJM Question: Is milrinone safer or more effective than dobutamine in the treatment of cardiogenic shock? Design: Single-centre blinded, 1:1 randomized and controlled, superiority trial Population: Consecutive adult patients admitted to the Ottawa CCU with cardiogenic shock (SCAI Stage B, C, D, E). Intervention: Milrinone (blinded) Comparator: Dobutamine (blinded) Outcomes: Primary: Composite of in-hospital mortality, resuscitated IHCA, cardiac transplant or MCS, nonfatal MI , TIA/stroke, RRT Results: N=192. Primary outcome: 49% vs 54% (RR 0.90, P=0.47). No difference in subgroups, time-to-event analysis Secondary outcomes: No differences in sub-primaries, CCU LOS, hospital LOS, NIV, invasive ventilation, AKI, biochemistry, arrhythmias, dose of other Vasopressors . Takeaway: No significant advantage of milrinone over dobutamine. Trend towards slightly reduced primary outcome. No differences in safety profile Underpowered study with some bias, and cannot rule out milrinone being better. For now, use either one -- whichever you are more comfortable with.

Clinical Presentation Hypotension, tachycardia, and ventricular arrhythmias are caused primarily by excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation. Acute single overdose Vomiting, tremor, anxiety, tachycardia. Hypokalemia (due to shift), hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis With serum levels above 90\u2013100 mg/L, hypotension, ventricular arrhythmias, and seizures are common; status epilepticus is frequently resistant to anticonvulsant drugs. Seizures and other manifestations of severe toxicity may be delayed 12\u201316 hours or more after ingestion, in part owing to delayed absorption of drug from sustained-release preparations. Chronic intoxication Occurs when excessive doses are administered repeatedly over 24 hours or longer or when intercurrent illness or an interacting drug interferes with the hepatic metabolism of theophylline. The usual victims are very young infants and elderly patients, especially those with chronic obstructive lung disease. vomiting is rarer. Tachycardia is common, hypotension is rare. Metabolic effects such as hypokalemia and hyperglycemia do not occur. Seizures may occur with lower serum levels (eg, 40\u201360 mg/L) and have been reported with levels as low as 20 mg/L. Diagnosis Based on ingestion history + presence of tremor, tachycardia, and other manifestations in patients known to be on theophylline. Hypokalemia strongly suggests acute overdose > chronic ingestion Serum theophylline levels. After acute oral overdose, obtain repeated levels every 2\u20134 hours; single determinations are not sufficient because continued absorption from sustained-release preparations may result in peak levels 12\u201316 hours or longer after ingestion. with chronic intoxication, severe toxicity may occur with levels of 40\u201360 mg/L. Levels of less than 80\u2013100 mg/L after acute overdose usually are not associated with severe symptoms, such as seizures and ventricular arrhythmias. Treatment Initial Measures Airway Seizures, arrythmia, hypotension management. Best approach with beta-adrenergic agents if required. Hypokalemia is due to shifting. Monitor vital signs, ECG, and serial theophylline levels for at least 16\u201318 hours after a significant oral overdose Specific Measures Hypotension, tachycardia, and ventricular arrhythmias are caused primarily by excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation. Treat with low dose propanolol 01\u20130.03 mg/kg IV, or esmolol 0.025/0.05 mg/kg/min. Decontamination - consider AOC +/- lavage +/- WBI Enhanced elimination - efficiently removed by HD, or repeat-dose activated charcoal.

Generally considered the first-choice opioid. M3G metabolite has neuroexcitatory properties which contributes to toxicity. M6G active metabolite is renally cleared, and theoretically contributes to respiratory depression. Hydromorphone Onset of IV action is 5-20 minutes due to its high lipid solubility. Consider this more strongly in renal disease as relatively lower concentration of renally cleared metabolites is produced. However, its HM3G metabolite is 2.5x more neuroexcitatory than M3G. It does not have an analgesically active metabolite unlike morphine.

Etiology Found to be a clonal neoplastic disorder, secondary to recurrent activating MAPK (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) pathway mutations. Epidemiology Incredibly rare, only about 800 cases reported in the literature. ECD is primarily a disease of middle-aged adults, with a mean age of 46 years at diagnosis in the United States. Male predominance (75%). Evaluation Clinical Manifestations Very diverse set of presentations. It is important to rule out concomitant myeloid neoplasms among ECD patients due to their high rates of co-occurrence. Key Clinical Features of Erdheim-Chester Disease lower extremity bone pain and bilateral osteosclerosis of metadiaphyses in lower limbs HPA axis and neuro-ophthalmologic abnormalities including central diabetes insipidus asymptomatic restrictive lung disease large-vessel vascular disease: aorta, renal pericardial effusions \"hairy kidney\" and perinephric retroperitoneal fibrosis myeloid neoplasms xanthelasma Organ Clinical and radiographic features Bones Lower-extremity bone pain is the most common presenting symptom (50%) ; full-body (skull-to-toes) FDG-PET-CT scan or 99mTc bone scintigraphy shows bilateral symmetric osteosclerosis of metadiaphysis of femur, tibia, and fibula in >95% cases and is pathognomonic ; skull and axial skeleton less commonly involved than LCH, which typically shows lytic punched-out lesions rather than sclerotic lesions that are seen in ECD Nervous system Seen in 25% to 50% patients, with predilection toward brain parenchyma of the posterior cranial fossa and dura, although infiltrations can occur throughout the neuraxis; these abnormalities often but do not invariably demonstrate gadolinium enhancement; rarely, may present with nontumorous neurodegenerative-like (atrophic) changes in the brainstem and cerebellum Retinal involvement has been reported as well. Clinical manifestations depend on the site of involvement, and may include ataxia, dysarthria, cognitive impairment, headaches, or peripheral neuropathy; some patients may present with mood lability Endocrine Anterior and posterior pituitary abnormalities (40% to 70%); most commonly central DI (25% to 50%) and may precede the diagnosis of ECD by several years, sometimes decades; other pituitary hormone deficiencies that are commonly seen are growth hormone, gonadotropin, thyrotropin, and corticotropin; hyperprolactinemia can be seen in 15% to 30% patients; although normal pituitary imaging does not exclude hormonal deficiency, an abnormal pituitary stalk MRI is commonly associated with hypopituitarism; primary hypothyroidism (20%), hypogonadism (19%), and adrenal insufficiency (6%) can be seen as well Orbit Unilateral or bilateral infiltration seen in 25% to 30% of patients; clinical manifestations include exophthalmos, retro-orbital pain, oculomotor nerve palsy or vision loss; differential diagnosis includes xanthogranuloma, RDD, Graves disease, granulomatous disease, and IgG4-related disease Respiratory Lung involvement in ECD is mostly asymptomatic and seen radiologically in \u223c50% of cases , involving either the lung parenchyma or pleura; unlike pulmonary LCH, no association with cigarette smoking has been reported; although plain chest radiographs can be normal, findings on CT of the chest may include mediastinal infiltration, pleural thickening or effusions, interlobular septal thickening, ground-glass opacities, or centrilobular opacities; pulmonary function tests commonly reveal a more restrictive as compared with an obstructive pattern; ECD may also involve facial sinuses, with maxillary sinus thickening in \u223c50% patients Cardiovascular Cardiovascular involvement may be asymptomatic but can be seen in 50% to 70% patients at imaging evaluation by CT and/or MRI; most common findings include pericardial infiltration with effusion (which may be complicated by tamponade) or myocardial infiltration in the form of right atrioventricular pseudotumor (40%); circumferential soft tissue sheathing of the thoracic/abdominal aorta and its branches may be seen as \u201ccoated\u201d aorta may be seen on CT scan (50% to 60%); periarterial involvement of renal vessels may lead to renovascular hypertension (20%), is responsive to stenting, and can be monitored with renal artery dopplers; involvement of other visceral vessels has been reported as well; coronary arteries may be involved in 30% to 50% of patients Retroperitoneum, including kidney Manifesting as infiltrative perinephric soft tissue thickening, or \u201chairy kidney\u201d (50% to 60%); perinephric infiltrates can rarely extend to involve the renal pelvis and/or renal ureters causing hydronephrosis and renal failure requiring dialysis and nephrostomy with stent placement; in some cases, it may also extend to involve the adrenal glands; longstanding perinephric ECD may lead to atrophy of kidneys; differential diagnosis includes retroperitoneal fibrosis and IgG4-related disease Cutaneous Seen in 20% to 30% patients, with one-half of the patients manifesting skin lesions as initial ECD presentation ; most common cutaneous manifestation is xanthelasma , occurring as yellowish plaques around the eyelids but can occur as yellowish-brown papules or plaques on the face, neck, axilla, trunk or groin as well; it may also present as subcutaneous nodules or granuloma annulare-like lesions Reticuloendothelial and hematopoietic system In one study, 11% of ECD patients had liver and spleen involvement, respectively, although the prevalence has been lower in other series; ECD rarely involves the lymph nodes, but may involve bone marrow in 8% of cases; ECD may also be associated with concomitant myeloid neoplasms in 10% of cases , specifically myeloproliferative neoplasm, myelodysplastic syndrome, or mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative overlap syndrome including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia Diagnosis ECD is not exclusively a pathologic diagnosis, and it is necessary to interpret histopathologic features in conjunction with clinical, radiographic, and, as of recently, molecular findings. ECD patients may see multiple providers and undergo several biopsies that have, historically, led to delayed diagnosis and institution of therapy in most patients, with the average time from symptom onset to diagnosis being a few months to several years. FDG PET-CT for ?symmetric osteosclerosis of the metadiaphysis of the lower-extremity bones as this is pathognomnic and present in 95% of cases. Tissue biopsy is required in all ECD cases, not only for confirmation of diagnosis, but also to allow identification of associated mutations for therapeutic purposes. As most ECD patients harbor activating somatic mutations or fusions in the genes of the MAPK-ERK or the PI3K-AKT pathway, molecular profiling of biopsy material can increase confidence in an ECD diagnosis in cases with ambiguous histopathological findings and/or absence of osseous lesions. BRAF-V600E mutation testing should be pursued for all patients Management Baseline Evaluation recommend FDG PET-CT imaging including the brain and distal extremities, MRI of the brain with gadolinium, and cardiac MRI in all newly diagnosed patients Dedicated CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is recommended to demonstrate pulmonary, periaortic, and perinephric infiltrates Laboratory studies are needed to assess endocrinopathies, peripheral blood count abnormalities, renal/hepatic function, immunological assessment, and the degree of inflammation Treatment Most patients with ECD require systemic treatment at diagnosis, with the exception of asymptomatic nonvital single-organ (eg, bone) or minimally symptomatic disease that may be monitored. The therapeutic landscape of ECD and related histiocytic neoplasms has changed drastically over the last 5 years due to the discovery of activating and targetable MAPK-ERK pathway mutations in the vast majority of patients: 1. BRAF inhibitors 1. Vemurafenib: most common adverse effects include cutaneous complications (rash, squamous cell cancer), arthralgia, QTc prolongation, and fatigue. 2. Dabrafenib: similar efficacy to vemurafenib, and less cutaneous toxicity than vemurafenib. 2. MEK inhibitors 1. Cobimetinib 2. Trametinib 3. First-line conventional therapy 1. IFN-\u03b1. Case series have demonstrated survival benefit with the use of some form of IFN-\u03b1; high-dose IFN-\u03b1 for patients with CNS or cardiac involvement; major limitation is the high frequency of systemic adverse effects. 2. Cladribine. Prophylactic antimicrobials against Pneumocystis jirovecii (cotrimoxazole) and viruses (acyclovir, valacyclovir) should be added during the duration of the treatment and until the lymphocyte count normalize. 3. Anakinra. Especially effective for bone pain and constitutional symptoms. 4. Second-line conventional therapy 1. Sirolimus + prednisone 2. Imatinib 3. Infliximab 4. Tocilizumab 5. MTX Followup and Prognosis/Outcomes FDG-PET-CT is considered the optimal modality for ECD response assessment. FDG PET imaging should be obtained 3 to 6 months after initiation of therapy to assess metabolic response. Complete metabolic response, that is, normalization of lesion FDG avidity to that of the surrounding organ background, is considered the optimal response to ECD therapy. Organ-specific imaging such as CT or MRI (eg, heart, brain, orbit) should be performed every 3 to 6 months initially, and every 6 to 12 months once disease stabilizes. Because of the tissue fibrosis associated with ECD, treated lesions may not fully regress, and therefore the degree of anatomic response (ie, shrinkage of lesions by CT/MRI) may not accurately reflect disease activity or response to treatment. This is particularly characteristic of longstanding lesions in the retroperitoneum, abdomen, orbits, and sinuses. Hence, anatomic, metabolic, and clinical responses must be considered in light of one another. Although skin involvement by ECD may respond to treatments, endocrinopathies are typically permanent. Additionally, monitoring for pituitary hormone abnormalities every 1 to 2 years is recommended. relapse is likely in BRAF -V600\u2013mutant ECD in the setting of complete cessation of vemurafenib without achieving sustained CR The prognosis of ECD can vary based on the site of disease and the response to therapy. Advances in diagnosis and therapeutics of ECD are underscored by the tremendous improvement in 5-year OS rates over the last 2 decades, from 43% in a study from 1996 to 83% in a recent study.

Tissue biopsy is required in all ECD cases, not only for confirmation of diagnosis, but also to allow identification of associated mutations for therapeutic purposes. As most ECD patients harbor activating somatic mutations or fusions in the genes of the MAPK-ERK or the PI3K-AKT pathway, molecular profiling of biopsy material can increase confidence in an ECD diagnosis in cases with ambiguous histopathological findings and/or absence of osseous lesions.

FDG PET imaging should be obtained 3 to 6 months after initiation of therapy to assess metabolic response. Complete metabolic response, that is, normalization of lesion FDG avidity to that of the surrounding organ background, is considered the optimal response to ECD therapy. Organ-specific imaging such as CT or MRI (eg, heart, brain, orbit) should be performed every 3 to 6 months initially, and every 6 to 12 months once disease stabilizes. Because of the tissue fibrosis associated with ECD, treated lesions may not fully regress, and therefore the degree of anatomic response (ie, shrinkage of lesions by CT/MRI) may not accurately reflect disease activity or response to treatment. This is particularly characteristic of longstanding lesions in the retroperitoneum, abdomen, orbits, and sinuses. Hence, anatomic, metabolic, and clinical responses must be considered in light of one another. Although skin involvement by ECD may respond to treatments, endocrinopathies are typically permanent. Additionally, monitoring for pituitary hormone abnormalities every 1 to 2 years is recommended. relapse is likely in BRAF -V600\u2013mutant ECD in the setting of complete cessation of vemurafenib without achieving sustained CR The prognosis of ECD can vary based on the site of disease and the response to therapy.

Gender: 2:1 predominance for males. Clinical Features Lymphadenopathy - most patients present with painless aymmetrical firm and discrete adenopathy. Nodal size can wax and wane spontaneously. Disease is typically localized initially to a single peripheral LN region and its subsequent progression is by lymphatic spread. Cervical nodes: 60-70% Axillary: 10-15% Inguinal nodes: 6-12% Retroperitoneal nodes often involved as well (needs CT scan) Splenomegaly - modest enlargement develops in 50% of patients. Mediastinal involvement - 10% of patients at presentation. Can be associated with pleural effusions or SVC syndrome. Cutaneous HL - late complication in 10% of patients. Prominent constitutional symptoms especially in patients with widespread disease: Fever (30%) which can be continuous or cyclic (Pel-Ebstein fever) Pruritus (25%) which can be severe Alcohol-induced pain Weight loss, night sweats, weakness, fatigue, anorexia, cachexia. Hematological and infectious complications Hematological and biochemical findings Normochromic normocytic anemia, leukoerythroblastic anemia. Neutrophilia (1/3) Eosinophilia Lymphopenia (advanced disease) and loss of cell-mediated immunity Elevated CRP and ESR Serum LDH is raised initially in 30-40% of cases HIV status should be determined Diagnosis and histological classification The diagnosis is made by histological examination of an excised lymph node. The distinctive multinucleate polyploid RS cell is central to the diagnosis of the four classic types and nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL which is RS-cell negative. Clinical Staging Treatment of HL Treatment is chemo +/- radiotherapy. The choice will depend on the stage, clinical state A or B (constitutional symptoms), and prognostic factors. Early-stage disease Outcomes are excellent. Chemo alone or in combination with radiotherapy. Combined modality treatment (CMT) has no clear long-term OS benefit. - Most patients with chemo alone: ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastina, dacarbazine) x 3 cycles - Most patients with CMT: ABVD x 2 cycles + 20Gy radiotherapy - Unfavourable disease: ABVD x 4-6 cycles + 30Gy radiotherapy for bulky disease Advanced-stage disease Cyclical chemotherapy is used for stage III and IV disease. Typically this is 6 cycles AVBD. Highest-risk patients can be treated with BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone). Relapsed cases Approx 25% of cases relapse or are refratory to initial therapy. Options include: 1) Alternative combination chemotherapy 2) Brentixumab 3) ASCT 4) Checkpoint inhibitors (PD-L1 or PD-1) Adjunct Management fertility management: semen storage for men, fertility advice for women blood transfusions: must be irradiated to avoid GVHD due to infusion of live donor lymphocytes which can engraft due to the impaired celllular immunity of the patient. Treatment: +/- radiation Prognosis Depends on the age, stage, and histology. Overall cure rate is 85%. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma a large group of clonal lymphoid tumours: 85% B cell origin 15% T/NK cell origin More variable clinical presentation and natural history than HL. Characterized by an irregular pattern of spreading and a significant proportion of patients have extranodal disease. Now the 5th most common malignancies in some developed countries. Etiology is generally unknown, although infectious causes are important in particular subtypes Classification of NHL Low-grade versus high-grade NHL can be subdivided into low- and high-grade disease low-grade: indolent, respond well to chemo, difficult to cure high-grade: aggressive, needs urgent treatment, are more often curable Clinical Features of NHL Superficial lymphadenopathy - asymmetric painless LN in one or more peripheral LN regions. Constitutional symptoms - fevers, night sweats, weight loss can occur but are less common than in HL, and their presence are associated with disseminated disease. Oropharyngeal involvement - 5-10% of patients have Waldeyer's ring involvement which can cause obstruction, pharyngitis symptoms Cytopenias - autoimmune or due to sequestration or diffuse bone marrow disease. Abdominal disease - hepatosplenomegaly, and often involves retroperitoneal or mesenteric nodes. GI tract is most commonly involved extranodal site after the bone marrow. Other organs - skin, brain, testis, thyroid involvement. Skin involvement particularly in Sezary syndrome and mycosis fungoides Investigations Histology - excisional whole LN biopsy, or core needle LN biopsy is required. FNA is unreliable due to loss of diasgnostic node architectural features. Lab investigations: Cytopenias particularly with leukerythroblastic features, splenomegaly Lymphoma cells (mantle zone cells, blast cells) in peripheral blood HIV for all patients Trephine biopsy of BM Serum LDH (correlates to proliferation rate and extent of disease, prognostic marker), and serum uric acid SPEP can show a paraprotein Cytogenetics - the various subtypes of NHL are associated with characteristic chromosomal translocations which provide diagnostic and prognostic value Staging NHL Same staging system as HL, but is less clearly related to prognosis than the histological subtype. LN are considered normal or abnormal on PET/CT based on the Deauville criteria . General Treatment of NHL Initial treatment is generally a combination of chemotherapy + monoclonal anti-tumour antibody. However, various new targeted drugs have been developed: 1) Oral agents against BTK/PI3K\u03b4 proteins - for B-cell CLL 2) Oral agents against ALK - for anaplastic large cell lymphoma 3) Oral agents against BCL-2 - e.g. venetoclax 4) CAR-T therapy is approved for relapsed/refractory patients with some subtypes of lymphoma Anti-CD20 antibodies in use: 1) Rituximab 2) Ofatumumab 3) Obinutuzumab Anti-CD30: brentuximab Specific NHL Subtypes Low-grade NHL Small lymphocytic lymphoma Same morphologic, immunophenotype, and cytogenetics as CLL, with few peripheral blood B cells and no cytopenias from BM involvement. Most patients are elderly and often no treatment is indicated. Waldernstrom macroglobulinemia (lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma) Rare, seen in men > 50. WM is a LPL with production of monoclonal IgM paraprotein. Insidious onset, B symptoms, hyperviscosity syndrome with visual upset. Possible cryoglobulinemia. Can also lead to anemia, bleeding diathesis, neurological involvement, heart failure. Treatment Indicated for organomegaly, symptomatic anemia, or hyperviscosity. Combination treatment with anti-CD20 antibody + chemotherapy. RTX given alone can cause a hyperviscosity \"flare\". Chemotherapy options include cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, bendamustine or bortezomib. Ibrutinib and acalabrutinib are effective in cases refractory to other drugs and are also becoming first-choice initial therapy, either alone or in combination with rituximab or another CD20 antibody. Autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is considered for advanced disease. Acute hyperviscosity syndrome is treated with plasmapheresis. Marginal Zone Lymphomas These are low-grade lymphomas that arise from the marginal zone of B cell germinal follicles. They are classified according to the anatomical site at which they arise: - gastric MALT (H pylori) - Splenic MZL - Nodal MZL Follicular Lymphoma About 25% of NHL, median age is 60 years. Associated with t(14; 18) translocation and constitutive BCL-2 expression. Presentation is painless LN. Mantle Cell Lymphoma The prognosis is usually poor and overall survival is 4\u20136 years, although 15% of patients show an indolent course similar to CLL. High-grade NHL Diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) These are a heterogenous group of disorders representing the classic 'high-grade' lymphomas. They typically present with rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy associated with a fast rate of cellular proliferation. Progressive infiltration may affect bone marrow, GI tract, brain, spinal cord, kidneys, other organs. - What are prognostic factors? Age, performance status, stage, number of extranodal sites, serum LDH, bulky disease > 5 cm, prior history of low-grade disease, AIDS. - What are common treatments? - R-CHOP for 6-8 cycles in 2 or 3-weekly cycles is the mainstay of treatment - Most patients get G-CSF - For patients with localized disease, combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be optimal - Prophylactic therapy to prevent CNS disease (intrathecal or high-dose systemic MTX) should be considered for patients with high risk disease, especially with BM involvement - Overall long-term survival is 65%. Primary mediastinal B cell Lymphoma Rare NHL that arises in the thymus, presenting mainly in adolescents and young adults. Treatment is R-CHOP or more intensive regimens +/- local radiotherapy or autologous transplant. Burkitt Lymphoma Occurs endemically or sporadically . - Endemic (African) BL is seen in areas with chronic malaria exposure and is associated with EBV infection . Associated with MYC oncogene dysregulation. Patients are typically children presenting with massive lymphadenopathy (often of the jaw) which is often very responsive to chemotherapy, although long-term cure is uncommon. - Sporadic BL can occur anywhere in the world, and EBV is seen in 20% of cases. Increased risk in HIV+. Incredibly proliferative. Excellent prognosis with chemotherapy +/- intrathecal chemotherapy. Primary CNS Lymphoma Rare tumours, more common in older patients and HIV+ patients. Treatment consists of high-dise MTX with high-dose cytosine arabinoside followed by whole-brain radiotherapy. Associated with long-term cognitive dysfunction. Lymphoblastic lymphoma B or T cell, overlap histologically with ALL. Occur in children and young adults. T-Cell Lymphomas Once again these comprise about 15% of NHL in Western countries (more in Asia). Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy Occurs in patients with lymphadenopathy, HSM, skin rashes, polyclonal increase in serum IgG. Treatment with chemo or histone deacetylase inhibitors. Mycosis fungoides This is a chronic cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that presents with severe pruritus and psoriasis-like eczematoid skin lesions that can become plaques and ulcerated tumours. In contrast to Sezary syndrome, there is NO circulating tumour cells. Deeper organs can be affected. Treatment is phototherapy or chemotherapy, and relapsed cases can be treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors. Sezary syndrome Dermatitis, generalized erythroderma, lymphadenopathy, circulating T-lymphoma cells. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma Associated with HTLV-1 infection. Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphomas (EATL) Associated with gluten-induced enteropathy and have a poor response to treatment. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma Common in children. CD30+ and associated with ALK overexpression. Treatment: crizotinib + brentuximab? Castleman disease This is a rare LPD that may in some subtypes progress to a B-cell lymphoma. Occurs in localized or multicentric form, most often affecting thoracic or abdominal nodes. Multicentric CD is more associated with HIV+ and systemic symptoms, with HHV-8 coinfection.

High-Risk, or Massive PE These patients present with hemodynamic instability, evidence of RV dysfunction, and possibly elevated cardiac enzymes. Hemodynamic instability is defined as: Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg for 15 minutes, fall in SBP >40 mmHg from baseline for 15 minutes), vasopressor requirement, or cardiac arrest Exclusion of sepsis, hypovolemic, new arrhythmia Intermediate Risk, or Submassive PE These patients have evidence of RV dysfunction, may have elevated cardiac enzymes, or an elevated PESI risk (class III-IV or sPESI >= 1) Low-Risk No hemodynamic compromise, normal cardiac enzymes (if tested), and no evidence of RV dysfunction low PESI risk class (I or II), sPESI = 0 RV Assessment Either with echocardiography or CT angiography. Resuscitation of PE Volume management Early vasopressors (NE) +/- inotropes (dobutamine) Consider thrombolysis Avoid intubation Consider ECMO for refractory cases Treatment Strategy Massive PE Strongly consider thrombolysis with tPA (make sure to review absolute and relative contraindications to thrombolysis). If there are absolute contraindications to lytics, then consider IR clot removal or surgical embolectomy . Submassive/Intermediate Risk PE Intermediate-High If there are no absolute contraindications to lysis, then consider smaller dose of tPA (0.5 mg/kg up to maximum 50 mg) over 2 hours If there are relative contraindications consider 25 mg tPA as a slow infusion If there are absolute contraindications then anticoagulation alone is preferred. Intermediate-Low Anticoagulation alone. Low-Risk PE Anticoagulation alone. Subsegmental PE Contentious area. A 2021 study found that the risk of 90-day recurrent VTE in non-anticoagulated patients with isolated single SSPE was ~2%, and those with multiple is about ~5.7%. Interesting, the 90-day risk of recurrent VTE in patients treated with anticoagulation is approx 3% based on prior studies. Therefore, there might not be a clinically significant risk reduction with full anticoagulation for patients with a single SSPE. The 2021 CHEST guidelines recommend surveillence over anticoagulation for those with low risk of recurrent VTE, and anticoagulation over surveillance for those at high risk of recurrent VTE. This only applies if proximal DVT is ruled out (with ultrasonography) What is the takeaway? As of 2022, if the patient has a single SSPE and no particular risk factors for recurrence or decompensation (active cancer, cardiopulmonary poor dysfunction, completely unprovoked), and bilateral compression US is negative for DVT, then it is reasonable to consider no anticoagulation and close monitoring instead (with perhaps repeat ultrasounds in 2-3 weeks). Thrombolysis Hold anticoagulation (IV heparin) before and during the infusion. Fully anticoagulate patients with IV UFH afterwards (resume without bolus when aPTT <2x ULN). Then, transition to oral agent once stable for 24-48 hours. a consistent finding among studies is that thrombolytic therapy leads to early hemodynamic improvement and, although a mortality benefit may exist, it occurs at a cost of increased major bleeding. Per the ESC 2019 guidelines: Thrombolytic therapy leads to faster improvements in pulmonary obstruction, PAP, and PVR in patients with PE, compared with UFH alone; these improvements are accompanied by a reduction in RV dilation on echocardiography. 10% risk of severe bleeding, 1.7% risk of intracranial hemorrhage (SRMA) Massive PE FDA approved regimen: IV tPA (alteplase) 100 mg over 2 hours. Consider in more urgent situations (none are shown to be superior) infusion over 15 minutes 20 mg IV bolus then 80 mg IV over 2 hours Intermediate Risk PE While not routinely considered, thrombolysis can be considered for patients on anticoagulation who are decompensating or have higher risk of early mortality, anticoagulation treatment. Some studies (particularly PEITHO ) have examined thrombolysis in submassive PE and generally find no balanced benefit from thrombolysis (perhaps improved hemodynamic or pulmonary hypertension status, against increased bleeding risk). The MOPETT study used a particular regimen of tPA 0.5 mg/kg (up to a max of 50 mg) given as a 10 mg bolus followed by the remainder over 2 hours (i.e. reduced dose) for a particular definition of submassive PE (\"moderate\", with few patients having RV dysfunction); it showed that the risk of pulmonary hypertension was reduced compared to anticoagulation alone. PEITHO (NEJM 2014) Among patients with submassive PE being treated with unfractionated heparin, administration of tenecteplase (30-50 mg IV once over 5-10 seconds) reduces a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or hemodynamic decompensation at 7 days when compared to placebo, though this was driven by reduced hemodynamic decompensation. Tenecteplase was associated with increased rates of major extracranial bleeding at 7 days (6.3% vs. 1.2%; P<0.001; NNH 20) and strokes at 7 days (2.4% vs. 0.2%; P=0.004; NNH 45).

Endothelial injury allows for either direct infection or formation of a nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) which can become infected during transient bacteremia. More virulent bugs tend to adhere directly to the endothelium. Other bugs tend to adhere to the NBTE. Risk factors for NBTE are valvular defects (MR, AS, AR), VSD, CHD, hypercoagulable states (marantic endocarditis), SLE, and antiphospholipid syndrome. Organisms deep within the vegetation are metabolically inactive and difficult to eradicate. Embolization of vegetation fragments can lead to distant infection or infarction. Intracardiac structures can be damaged (perivalvular abscesses, conduction blocks), and tissue damage arises from immune complex deposition or responses to deposited bacterial antigens. Risk factors are fairly obvious: congenital heart diseases chronic rheumatic heart disease IV drug use degenerative valves intracardiac devices ( ICD , pacemaker, etc) old age prosthetic valves bioprosthetics and mechanicals have similar risk profiles risk is greatest in the first 6 to 12 mo risk declines to a low, stable level after Causative organisms are typically bacteria, but can be fungal as well.

Endothelial injury allows for either direct infection or formation of a nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) which can become infected during transient bacteremia. More virulent bugs tend to adhere directly to the endothelium. Other bugs tend to adhere to the NBTE. Risk factors for NBTE are valvular defects (MR, AS, AR), VSD, CHD, hypercoagulable states (marantic endocarditis), SLE, and antiphospholipid syndrome. Organisms deep within the vegetation are metabolically inactive and difficult to eradicate. Embolization of vegetation fragments can lead to distant infection or infarction. Intracardiac structures can be damaged (perivalvular abscesses, conduction blocks), and tissue damage arises from immune complex deposition or responses to deposited bacterial antigens.

This strongly suggests that, for patients receiving CKRT with ongoing hypotension or vasopressor dependence, transition to intermittent HD from CKRT should be deferred. mechanisms: myocardial stunning, ultrafiltration, rapid osmotic shifts associated with higher risk of death and impaired renal function Mitigation Strategies Mechanism Strategy Hypovolemia reduced UF goal, longer duration, lower blood flow rate, isolated UF, hypertonic solutions (albumin, mannitol, hypertonic saline), Na profiling Myocardial stunning Cooler dialysate temperature, higher dialysate [Ca++] Decreased SVR Cooler dialysate temperature, higher dialysate [Ca++], midodrine Overall, the best-supported practice for mitigating hemodynamic instability related to intermittent HD in patients who are critically ill are the routine use of low-temperature dialysate and increased dialysate sodium concentration/sodium profiling. The effect of these and any of the other strategies used to mitigate hemodynamic instability during intermittent HD on clinically relevant outcomes remains unknown. If other parameters have been optimized and hemodynamic instability continues to limit achievement of ultrafiltration goals, initiation or uptitration of agents such as the oral \u03b1 -1 agonist midodrine or intravenous Vasopressors are pharmacologic options that can mitigate hemodynamic instability. A transition to PIKRT or CKRT could also be considered. CRRT in Critically Ill Patients Although CKRT is often considered standard of care for patients who are hemodynamically unstable and requiring KRT, data to prove superiority of CKRT over intermittent HD or PIKRT have been elusive Outcomes/Trials for CRRT vs IHD CKRT has been compared with intermittent HD in observational studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and meta-analyses with largely equivalent outcomes, including mortality and kidney recovery. 1.

Background treatment of glycemic control and CV risk modification per local guidelines. Outcome Outcome Intervention Control HR Primary: MAKE 43.2 61.2 0.70 (0.59 to 0.82) Summary The results of this trial indicate that canagliflozin is superior to placebo in improving glycemic control and reducing adverse renal events among patients with DM2 and established CKD. Canagliflozin also reduced CV events in this patient population. These benefits were independent of baseline HbA1c. Risk of complications, including amputation, was similar between the two groups. All patients were on baseline ACEi/ARB. A similar protective effect on renal outcomes was noted with empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, but CREDENCE was specifically designed to enroll CKD patients, not high CV risk patients (as in EMPA-REG OUTCOME). These are really important findings and suggest that canagliflozin (and perhaps the sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 class of agents) may need to be considered routinely among similar patients with DM2 and CKD who are already on a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor going forward. This may also be true for patients with so-called \u201cwell controlled diabetes\u201d (i.e., those with HbA1c between 6.5 and 7%). Between 22 to 25 patients would need to be treated for approximately 2.5 years in order to prevent one occurrence of the primary composite outcome. Applies to patients with: Moderate CKD Diabetes Already on ACE/ARB DAPA-CKD This trial is a complement to CREDENCE, which showed cardiovascular and renal benefits of canagliflozin in patients with T2DM with mild CKD.

Canagliflozin also reduced CV events in this patient population. These benefits were independent of baseline HbA1c. Risk of complications, including amputation, was similar between the two groups. All patients were on baseline ACEi/ARB. A similar protective effect on renal outcomes was noted with empagliflozin in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, but CREDENCE was specifically designed to enroll CKD patients, not high CV risk patients (as in EMPA-REG OUTCOME). These are really important findings and suggest that canagliflozin (and perhaps the sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 class of agents) may need to be considered routinely among similar patients with DM2 and CKD who are already on a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor going forward. This may also be true for patients with so-called \u201cwell controlled diabetes\u201d (i.e., those with HbA1c between 6.5 and 7%).

Most commonly this causes periods of physical rigidity, negativism, or stupor (although psychomotor hyperactivity may also occur). Although catatonia is traditionally associated with schizophrenia, it is more often triggered by acute medical illness or affective disorders (e.g., bipolar disorder). The diagnosis of catatonia in the context of psychiatric disorders can be challenging, as there may be overlapping features of both conditions. Recognition of catatonia is essential because it is a highly treatable condition which responds to specific interventions. Alternatively, provision of nonspecific supportive care may often fail (especially in malignant catatonia). Catatonia is a spectrum disorder which varies in severity (rather than a binary, dichotomous condition).

Incidence is 1:100,000. Increased risk with male sex and increased age. Follows a typical clinical pattern, usually preceded by infection or immune trigger. The diagnosis is largely clinical. Etiology Onset is 1-2 weeks after immune stimulation. s/p acute infectious process (70%) usually respiratory or GI infection 20-30% of cases are due to Campylobacter jejuni Other common inciting pathogens are a HHV infection such as EBV or CMV, HIV, hepatitis E, influenza A, arboviruses (Zika virus, Chikungunya), Mycoplasma pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae s/p vaccination H1N1 influenza vaccine Semple Rabies vaccine lupus lymphoma Pathogenesis/Immunology Essentially, this is an autoimmune process leading to acute neuropathy which can be either (1) demyelinating or (2) axonal (motor or sensory) in type. This process is likely antibody-mediated, driven by molecular mimicry between microbial and cellular surface antigens. The axonal neuropathy subtypes are more associated with anti-GM1 and anti-GD1a IgG autoantibodies. Clinical Features rapidly (hours to days) ascending paralysis may be noticed as \"rubbery legs\" at first frequently accompanied with tingling dysesthesias in the extremities legs > arms facial diparesis in 50% lower cranial nerve involvement with bulbar weakness and difficulty handling secretions areflexia ventilatory support (30%) required cutaneous sensorium mostly preserved as these are small fibers that are not affected as much autonomic involvement transient bladder dysfunction loss of vasomotor control blood pressure changes postural hypotension cardiac dysrhythmia pain acute neck, back, spine pain (50%) deep, aching muscular-type pain dysesthetic pain in the extremities due to sensory fibre involvement In terms of the timeframe , most patients plateau in symptoms within 4-6 weeks and progression beyond that point is unlikely.

Age, the stage of a cancer, and other illnesses all affect prognosis, but PS is one of the most important variables. It is more important than a patient\u2019s actual age in predicting how a patient is likely to do. Patients who have a worse PS and limited functional capacity tend to have more difficulty tolerating rigorous cancer treatments. These patients have less favorable outcomes than more fit patients with better PS, regardless of the treatments given. Many clinical trials, and the treatment recommendations that are developed from them, are restricted to more fit patients, such as those with a PS of 0 to 1 on the Zubrod scale or higher than 70 on the Karnofsky scale. As a result, there is less clinical evidence available for treatments for more frail patients with lower PS. Because nearly all anticancer treatments have potentially serious adverse effects, the risks of using certain treatments in low-PS patients may far exceed the benefits. However, other trials testing less intensive treatment approaches may allow or even focus specifically on more frail patients who need more support. Patient PS can and usually does change over time. Patients can experience a gradual worsening of their PS as their cancer progresses, both from the cancer itself and from the cumulative adverse effects of treatments. On the other hand, effective treatment can lead to an improvement in PS if a patient is limited by cancer-related symptoms (as opposed to other chronic medical conditions unrelated to cancer) that improve as the cancer responds to treatment. Both the KPS and ECOG scales are strong independent predictors of clinical outcome in numerous oncology populations.

Upper Lobe\u2013Predominant Diseases of the Lung. American Journal of Roentgenology . 2013;200(3):W222-W237. doi: 10.2214/AJR.12.8961 Background In an erect individual, the lung apex is relatively overventilated (ratio of ventilation to perfusion, 3:1), and the base is relatively overperfused (ratio, 0.6:1). Therefore, conditions caused by inhalation of toxic substances primarily affect the apices of the lung. Lymphatic particle clearance is relatively decreased in the apices because the lymphatic flow is driven by perfusion as well as respiratory excursion, both of which are relatively deceased in the upper lung zones. This explains why granulomatous disorders, such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, appear predominantly in the upper lobes. In addition, metabolic factors, such as regional uptake of oxygen, elimination of carbon dioxide, and pH in the lung, differ due to inequalities of the ventilation-perfusion ratio.

Therefore, conditions caused by inhalation of toxic substances primarily affect the apices of the lung. Lymphatic particle clearance is relatively decreased in the apices because the lymphatic flow is driven by perfusion as well as respiratory excursion, both of which are relatively deceased in the upper lung zones. This explains why granulomatous disorders, such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, appear predominantly in the upper lobes. In addition, metabolic factors, such as regional uptake of oxygen, elimination of carbon dioxide, and pH in the lung, differ due to inequalities of the ventilation-perfusion ratio. These factors contribute to the upper zone predisposition of conditions such as metastatic pulmonary calcification and tuberculosis.

COP has no identifying cause and is under the umbrella of Interstitial Lung Disease > Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias (IIPs) . It is formerly called bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) . Often misdiagnosed, and can be very responsive to treatment. Secondary forms of OP are due to a specific cause (infection, drug toxicity, inhalation injury, radiation, cancer) or within another clinical context (CTD, aspiration, transplantation, interstitial pneumonia). Variants Focal organizing pneumonia (<15%) which must be distinguished from lung cancer. Might be resectable. Fulminant COP. First rule out infection then consider IV steroids. High mortality rate from respiratory failure. Cicatricial OP. Acute fibrinous OP. Patchy infiltration. Epidemiology and Pathophysiology COP reasonably rare; 7 per 100,000 hospital admissions. 5-10% of ILD diagnoses. Mean age is 50-60, men > women. About 50% smokers. Poorly defined pathogenesis. Lung injury occurs as a single event and causes an inflammatory and fibroproliferative process characterized by intra-alveolar fibroproliferation that is reversaible with therapy. Contrasted to other fibrotic processes such as UIP which are not reversible. Alveolar injury --> inflammatory response --> fibroblast response --> protein dysregulation --> interstitial remodeling Secondary Causes of Organizing Pneumonia infection (bacterial, viral, parasitic, fungal) drugs (amiodarone, nitrofurantoin, bleomycin, MTX, cocaine) CTD (RA, Sjogren's, myositis, SScl, anti-synthetase syndrome, vasculitis) Hematologic cancer Transplantation (lung, liver, BM) Radiation injury CVID Other ILD (eosinophilic pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonia, UIP) IBD Other other lung processes: abscess, DAH, airway obstruction Inhalation injury Clinical Presentation Suspect COP when patients with a ?pneumonia do not respond to antibiotic treatment. Symptoms are often subacute and develop over weeks to months: - dry cough, dyspnea are most common - influenza-like symptoms are possible (10-15%) - fever is common (44%) - hemoptysis is rare (<5%) Examination reveals inspiratory crackles (60%), rarely clubbing (<3%). Rarely the examination is normal (<5%). Evaluation Noninvasive Tests Lab tests reveal evidence of inflammation. Consider testing for CTDs as COP can precede CTD manifestations by weeks to months. PFTs show restricted ventilatory defects and a reduced DLCO, but are normal lung volumes in 25% of patients. Obstruction is not a feature of COP. Hypoxemia is common. Imaging is usually distinctive: bilateral opacities (patchy/diffuse and consolidative or hazy) with normal lung volumes. CT is better than CXR. On CT, the pattern is peripheral and multifocal consolidation +/- bronchograms, with lesions in all lung zones, and slightly predominant subpleural and lower-lung distribution. Other findings: GGO Nodules 8 mm in diameter in a well-defined acinar pattern Reverse halo pattern (<5%) Invasive Tests BAL is recommended if COP is suspected to rule out infection and other disorders (eosinophilic pneumonia, DAH). Typically BAL shows lymphocytic alveolitis with increased neutrophils and eosinophils. Histopathology is not alway needed to make the diagnosis. Differential Diagnosis CAP Hypersensitivity pneumonitis Eosinophilic penumonia Alveolar hemorrhage Vasculitis Pulmonary lymphoma, invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma Management Treatment of COP is empirical because no prospective RCTs have been done. Less than 10% of patients have spontaneous improvement, but they typically had milder disease. Steroids systemic steroids are the preferred treatment Prednisone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day up to 60 mg/day, for 2-4 weeks initially then tapered to 0.25 mg/kg/day depending on the clinical response to complete 4-6 months of therapy. Over the next 6 to 12 months the steroids are tapered to zero if the patient's condition allows. Clinical improvement should manifest within 1-3 days. First symptoms decrease then radiologic findings improve within 3 months. PJP ppx recommended for more than 20 mg prednisone per day Consider pulse steroids (500-1000 mg methylprednisolone for 3-5 days) for sick patients then step down to oral regimen above. Relapses Defined by worsening symptoms or new radiolographic findings during or after steroid treatment. Rare, less than 25% during the first year. Can occur when tapering or stopping therapy too quickly, and generally when prednisone < 15 mg/day. Associated with delayed diagnosis, delayed treatment, severe disease, traction bronchiectasis, abnormal DLCO, cholestasis, hypoxemia, and advanced fibrosis. Treat with resuming or increasing steroids, consider <20 mg/d based on studies showing equal efficacy. Not associated with morbidity or mortality. Other Therapies Considered for those who need additional agents or cannot tolerate steroids: - Macrolides - Cytotoxic therapy (AZA, CYC) - Antimetabolites etc (MMF, CsA, RTX, IVIg) Prognosis Generally, COP has an excellent prognosis. Progressive respiratory failure or death are rare (<10%), and 5-year survival rate is >90%. Despite this, of course patients have higher mortality than the general population. Secondary organizing pneumonia has a slightly worse prognosis, due to the underlying illness. References King TE, Lee JS. Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia.

Therefore, only are indicated if there are severe symptoms or end-organ damage: pulmonary: bothersome symptoms of SOB, cough. Deteriorating lung function with PFTs, and development of pulmonary hypertension. extrapulmonary disease: eye disease, CNS disease, cardiomyopathy or active cardiac involvement. typically also severe skin disease, hypercalcemia, symptomatic liver disease.

Otherwise can consider steroid-sparing agents (MTX, HCQ, LEF, TNFi) if relapse occurs. Sarcoidosis-associated fatigue should prompt consideration for pulmonary rehab, inspiratory muscle training, or trial of D-methylphenidate or modafinil for 8 weeks. Prognosis and Outcomes 5% mortality risk. Most patients are asymptomatic. 2/3 will have remisson in a decade, after one year of spontaneous remission relapse is uncommon.

Unstable Patients Immediate chest tube thoracostomy, or if delayed, then needle decompression. Tension PTX is rare in PSP Initial Management Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax Small PSP If first episode of PSP, then these patients can be treated with observation +/- oxygen. Hospital admission generally not required. Supplemental oxygen theoretically improves resolution of the PTX by promoting nitrogen/air absorption. Target SpO2 >96-100% (unclear evidence), avoid positive pressure if possible (HFNC, NIV). Try for about 4-6 hours then get a repeat CXR if there are significant attributable symptoms, then consider aspiration or chest tube thoracostomy (as well as searching for other lung disorders or diagnoses). Large PSP First episode of PSP: consider all of the following: aspiration. Most guidelines suggest the standard of care with a large stable first PSP is needle or catheter aspiration. continue aspiration until resistance is felt or 2.5-4L of air is aspirated Catheter could be left in place with a Heimlich valve (See below) chest tube thoracostomy +/- ambulatory device Initial observation only approach is supported by the recent PSP trial (NEJM 2020) which suggests that conservative observational management of PSP is noninferior to interventional management, with a lower risk of serious adverse events. Patients should be generally healthy with mild symptoms, no hemodynamic compromise, no supplemental oxygen requirement, and ambulatory. Heimlich valve Chest Tube Management PSP Size/Device: In most patients with PSP, a small-bore chest tube (\u226422 Fr) or chest catheter (\u226414 Fr) is placed. In most cases, a small caliber tube or catheter is sufficient for the drainage of air in patients with PSP. It is unusual in this population that an indication for a large-bore chest tube (eg, 22 to 28 Fr) is present unless the patient is unstable with tension pneumothorax, concomitant drainage of viscous pleural fluid (eg, empyema) or blood is needed, or small-bore catheter drainage is insufficient. One systematic review that compared small-bore pigtail catheters with large-bore chest tubes in patients with both PSP and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) reported that the success rate was similar in both groups (80 versus 83 percent) but pigtail catheters had a lower complication rate (odds ratio 0.49) and shorter drainage duration (mean difference -1.51 days) and hospital stay (mean difference -2.54 days). Suction For the majority of patients, suction is not initially applied and the tube or catheter is connected to a water seal device only. Lung re-expansion is achieved in 70 percent of patients within 72 hours without suction If the lung fails to re-expand within the subsequent 24 to 48 hours, worsens despite chest tube drainage, or develops a persistent air leak, low wall suction can be applied and, in some cases, a second drainage device may be needed. If suction is applied, we generally start with low rates of -10 cm H2O and increase to -20 cm H2O using a high pressure-low volume system; other forms of suction using high pressure-high volume or low pressure-high volume systems should be avoided. prolonged use of suction may lead to a delay in definitive management by prolonging air flow through the leak, thereby slowing down the natural healing of a ruptured bleb Followup thoracostomy management daily assessment of symptoms, air leak, complications of the chest thoracostomy (blockade, pain, bleeding). Daily CXR is not always required. once the air leak is sealed, then clamp the tube/catheter serial assessment + followup CXR if PTX not recurred, then the tube can be removed if the PTX recurs, then unclamp and repeat the process Management of Persistent or Recurrent PSP indications for this strategy: prolonged air leak [PAL] (>5 days) recurrent PSP therapeutic options: pleurodesis VATS > open thoracotomy Air Travel Recommendations for air travel passengers after pneumothorax are largely based on anecdotal case reports [ 110 , 111 ].
