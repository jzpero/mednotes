    <p>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (CAR-T) describes the use of genetically engineered T cells to attack cancer cells, and to improve the outcomes of patients with refractory/relapsed B-cell malignancies. Extended indications are being investigated (multiple <a href="../../Malignant%20Hematology/Myeloma/">myeloma</a>, etc.)</p>
<h1 id="background-of-car-t">Background of CAR-T</h1>
<p>CAR-T products generally attack CD19 which is expressed by most B-cell malignancies. CAR-T can induce temporary or durable complete remission in the majority of patients.</p>
<p>CAR-T cells are "living drugs" individualised for each unique cancer patient. Prior to entering CAR-T cell therapy, patients are often bridged with cytotoxic drugs, B-cell antibodies (e.g. RTX), or radiotherapy.  Prior to receiving CAR-T, patients receive lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy to ensure tolerate and persistence of the CAR-T product.</p>
<p>After CAR-T, patients can develop significant acute toxicities, namely <a href="./#Cytokine%20Release%20Syndrome%20(CRS)">Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)</a> and <a href="./#Immune%20effector%20Cell–Associated%20Neurotoxicity%20Syndrome%20(ICANS)">Immune effector Cell–Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS)</a>. These can range in severity from minor transient symptoms to severe life-threatening conditions.</p>
<p>CAR-T adverse toxicities correlate with high disease burden, higher peak of CAR-T cell expansion in the peripheral blood, and a high baseline inflammatory activity. More common in ALL than DLBCL</p>
<h1 id="cytokine-release-syndrome-crs">Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)</h1>
<p>CRS is a systemic inflammatory syndrome caused by immunotherapy, characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction.</p>
<p>CRS is the most common acute toxicity following CAR-T cell therapy (incidence is 37-93%). Generally occurs within hours to 1 week post CAR-T cell infusion; late occurence up to 14 days has been described. About 1/2 of patients require some form of immunomodulatory therapy.</p>
<p>CRS is caused by excess immune reaction stimulated in the setting of infections, immunomodulating drugs, etc. Associated with increased IL-6 levels.</p>
<h2 id="diagnosis-and-grading-of-crs">Diagnosis and Grading of CRS</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fever (T &gt;38℃) is required for the diagnosis of CRS.</li>
<li>Nonspecific symptoms: malaise, myalgia, fatigue, GI symptoms, tachycardia, rash.</li>
<li>Cardiac: arrhythmias, vasodilatory shock, systolic HF or new onset cardiomyopathy</li>
<li>Respiratory: hypoxia</li>
<li>AKI</li>
<li>Labs:<ol>
<li>Hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia</li>
<li>Concurrent tumour lysis syndrome</li>
<li>Elevated CRP</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Can range from self-limiting symptoms improved with symptomatic care, all the way to severe SIRS and MODS with high rates of mortality.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>CRS can co-exist with ICANS.</strong>
After treatment with steroids and tocilizumab, fever may abate and is then not required for the diagnosis of CRS.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230801213104.png" /></p>
<h2 id="management-of-crs">Management of CRS</h2>
<ol>
<li>Consider empiric antimicrobial coverage, as differential frequently includes sepsis or septic shock.</li>
<li>Avoid the use of G-CSF as this can exacerbate CRS.</li>
<li>Consider the presence of ICANS as well, and treat as necessary. However, tocilizumab can worsen ICANS. Should lean more heavily on steroids if so.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="../_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230801210432.png" /></p>
<h3 id="refractory-crs">Refractory CRS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consider anakinra or ruxolitinib. </li>
<li>Consider the diagnosis of HLH - the patient can have an overlap syndrome of treatment-refractory CRS and HLH.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="immune-effector-cellassociated-neurotoxicity-syndrome-icans">Immune effector Cell–Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS)</h1>
<p>ICANS is encephalopathy secondary to systemic inflammation. Often occurs in the context of CRS, but not always. Has parallels in pathophysiology to sepsis-induced encephalopathy, but full mechanisms of disease are not known at this time. Key features seem to be disruption of the BBB and cytokine induced cerebral edema.</p>
<p>ICANS is extremely common, occurring in perhaps ~75% of patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel or brexucabtagene autoleucel. Lower rates occur with other CAR-T constructs.</p>
<p><strong>Risk factors for ICANS:</strong> Fludarabine use for pre-treatment lymphodepletion, anti-CD19 products, ALL&gt; lymphoma &gt;&gt; multiple <a href="../../Malignant%20Hematology/Myeloma/">myeloma</a>, higher burden of malignancy, pre-existing neurologic conditions, severe or early onset CRS, elevated inflammatory markers, DIC.</p>
<p><strong>Timing of ICANS:</strong> generally begins within the first week after CAR-T therapy. Median onset of illness is 4-6 days, but can extend out to months after CAR-T therapy. Often ICANS starts 2-4 post CRS.</p>
<p><strong>Duration of ICANS:</strong> about 2-3 weeks, but the encephalopathy can last months.</p>
<h2 id="diagnosis-and-grading-of-icans">Diagnosis and Grading of ICANS</h2>
<h3 id="clinical-manifestations">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Language abnormalities<ul>
<li>Dysgraphia or expressive dysphagia</li>
<li>Evolution into global aphasia is highly suggestive of ICANS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tremor, fine motor impairment, asterixis, myoclonus.</li>
<li>Altered level of consciousness.</li>
<li>Fluctuating over time.</li>
<li>Focal or generalized weakness</li>
<li>Autonomic instability.</li>
<li>Headache, meningeal irritation</li>
<li>Seizures and status epilepticus.</li>
<li>Clinical manifestations of cerebral edema and <a href="../../Critical%20Care/Neuro%20Critical%20Care/Elevated%20ICP/">Elevated ICP</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="radiology-and-neurologic-investigations">Radiology and Neurologic Investigations</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Neuroimaging is recommended for Grade 2 and above.</strong> MRI +/- contrast is the preferred modality. However, most patients with ICANS have normal neuroimaging. Potential findings on neuroimaging:<ol>
<li>Symmetric T2/FLAIR hyperintensities involving the thalami and dorsal pons and tectal plate.</li>
<li>Patchy reversible T2 hyperintensities in the WM</li>
<li>Diffuse cerebral edema.</li>
<li>Leptomeningeal enhancement.</li>
<li>PRES-like findings.</li>
<li>Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.</li>
<li>Nonaneurysmal convexity <a href="../../Neurology/Cerebrovascular%20Disease/Subarachnoid%20Hemorrhage/">Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>CSF analysis to exclude CNS infection - consider in higher grade ICANS.<ol>
<li>elevated OP suggests Grade 4 ICANS</li>
<li>Cytologic ?malignancy or hemophagocytosis</li>
<li>JC virus PCR r/o PML</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>EEG to assess for seizures and the severity of encephalopathy.</li>
</ol>

</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="../_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230801213832.png" /></p>
<h3 id="steroids">Steroids</h3>
<p>Steroids are the mainstay of treatment of ICANS. Dexamethasone has greater CNS penetration thus is preferred over other steroids.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grade 1</strong>:<ul>
<li>Isolated ICANS: Steroid generally isn't indicated. However, for lisocabtagene maraleucel or idecabtagene vicleucel, if ICANS develops &lt;72 hours after infusion then consider dexamethasone 10 mg every 12-24 hours x2 doses and reassess.</li>
<li>ICANS plus CRS: Consider adding steroid for patients who are receiving tocilizumab (as discussed above, <em>isolated tocilizumab may worsen ICANS</em>). <a href="https://emcrit.org/ibcc/cart/#cytokine_release_syndrome_(CRS)">📖</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Grade 2</strong>:<ul>
<li>One dose of IV dexamethasone 10 mg and reassess.</li>
<li>Can repeat every 6-12 hours, if no improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Grade 3</strong>:<ul>
<li>All patients should receive dexamethasone 10 mg q6hr, until there is improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Grade 4</strong>:<ul>
<li>High-dose methylprednisolone (e.g., 1,000 mg daily for three days, then 250 mg q12hr for 2 days, then 125 mg q12hr for 2 days, then 60 mg q12 hours for 2 days).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steroid-refractory-icans">Steroid-Refractory ICANS</h3>
<p>Steroids generally lead to rapid improvement. Consider anakinra or ruxolitinib.</p>
<h3 id="seizure-prophylaxis">Seizure Prophylaxis</h3>
<p>Consider seizure prophylaxis (LEV) for axicabtagene ciloleucel with any grade of neurological toxicity, brexucabtagene autoleucel with Grade 2 or higher neurologic toxicity, patients at increased risk for seizures based on imaging or clinical history.</p>
