    <h1 id="guillain-barre-syndrome-gbs">Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)</h1>
<p>GBS (i.e. acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy or AIDP) is an acute inflammatory polyneuropathy with a reported incidence of 1:100,000 person-years. The risk of GBS increases exponentially with age (<strong>+20% per decade of life</strong>) and is higher in males than females. GBS is the most common and severe acute paralytic neuropathy.  GBS follows a typical clinical pattern, usually preceded by infection or immune trigger. The diagnosis is largely clinical.</p>
<h1 id="pathogenesisimmunology">Pathogenesis/Immunology</h1>
<p>Essentially, this is an autoimmune process leading to <strong>acute neuropathy</strong> which can be either <strong>(1) demyelinating</strong> or <strong>(2) axonal (motor or sensory)</strong> in type. This process is likely antibody-mediated, driven by molecular mimicry between microbial and cellular surface antigens.</p>
<p>The axonal neuropathy subtypes are more associated with <strong>anti-GM1</strong> and <strong>anti-GD1a</strong> IgG autoantibodies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>70% of cases are triggered by preceding infections (~3-12 days prior)</strong><ul>
<li>20-30% of cases are due to <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em></li>
<li>Other common inciting pathogens are HHV infection such as EBV or CMV, HIV, hepatitis E, influenza A, arboviruses (Zika virus, Chikungunya), <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>less commonly, after some vaccinations (?H1N1, Semple rabies virus)</li>
<li>less commonly, triggered by immune/neoplastic conditions (lupus, lymphoma)</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../_attachments/41582_2014_Article_BFnrneurol2014121_Fig2_HTML.webp" /></p>
<h1 id="clinical-presentation">Clinical Presentation</h1>
<p>GBS commonly presents as a <em>rapidly progressing symmetric ascending flaccid paralysis</em> in which leg symptoms are first, with later arm involvement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patients are areflexic</strong> due to the demyelinating/axonal processes of the LMN.</li>
<li><strong>Paraesthesias can be present</strong> if the sensory nerves are involved. Generally, cutaneous sensory function is preserved as these are small fibers.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomic features</strong> can be cardiac arrhythmias (bradycardia, orthostasis), sweating abnormalities, urinary retention, gastrointestinal dysfunction, unreactive/dilated pupils</li>
<li><strong>Lower cranial nerves can be involved</strong> with bulbar weakness and secretion difficulties.</li>
<li><strong>Neuropathic pain</strong> is common (neck, back, spine)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="miller-fischer-syndrome">Miller-Fischer Syndrome</h2>
<p><em>Miller-Fischer syndrome</em> is comprised of a clinical triad of (1) ataxia (2) areflexia (3) ophthalmoplegia causing diplopia. It is most associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies which is strongly associated with <em>C. jejuni</em>. MFS may be less responsive to immunotherapy than classic GBS. Peripheral muscle strength tends to be preserved unless an overlap syndrome exists (MRC 4-5/5).</p>
<h2 id="bickerstaff-brainstem-encephalitis">Bickerstaff Brainstem Encephalitis</h2>
<p><em>Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis</em> syndrome (BBE) is also associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies and is characterized by progressive symmetric ophthalmoplegia and ataxia with mental status changes such as coma or stupor;  pyramidal signs such as hyperreflexia or pathologic reflexes; or pupillary abnormalities and bulbar palsy. Peripheral muscle strength tends to be preserved in pure BBE.</p>
<h1 id="clinical-course-of-gbs">Clinical Course of GBS</h1>
<p>Patients reach their nadir by 4-6 weeks. The progressively worsening phase lasts less than 1 week in half of patients, and less than 2 weeks in 80% of patients. The plateau may last 1 week to several months, and then transitions to the recovery phase of illness.</p>
<p>Patients with acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) can have two patterns of recovery: rapid or prolonged recovery.</p>
<p>20% of GBS patients cannot walk without assistance after 6 months, but almost all patients regain this ability within a few years. Most patients will still have residual pain and fatigue on a chronic basis.</p>
<p>Overall mortality is 3-7% and is generally from ventilatory/pulmonary failure, or autonomic dysfunction leading to arrhythmias.</p>
<h1 id="diagnostic-testing">Diagnostic Testing</h1>
<h2 id="tests-to-perform">Tests to Perform</h2>
<ol>
<li>FVC</li>
<li>PVR</li>
<li>MRI whole spine with gadolinium</li>
<li>CBC, lytes, urea, Cr, INR/PTT</li>
<li>LP for ?albuminocytologic dissociation</li>
<li>EMG/NCS</li>
<li>Consider anti-GQ1b antibodies</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="general-investigations">General Investigations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nerve conduction studies: slowing of nerve conduction, increased latency , or axonal loss pattern with decreased cMAP.</li>
<li>CSF testing: elevated protein with lack of increased cells which is known as  albuminocytologic dissociation. Mild pleocytosis can be possible (15%) but is typically transient</li>
<li>Anti-GQ1b IgG can be more sensitive for MFS (positive in 85% of MFS in the first week of disease)</li>
<li>BBE can show brainstem, thalamic, cerebellar, and cerebral involvement on MRI</li>

<h2 id="airway-management">Airway Management</h2>
<p>Close monitoring is required: telemetry, BP, FVC q4h. Consider <strong>elective <a href="../../../Critical%20Care/Procedures/Intubation/">intubation</a> using the 20-30-40 rule:
FVC &lt;20 mL/kg, MIP 0 to -30 cm H2O, or MEP &lt; 40 cm H2O</strong>.</p>
<p>Predictors of respiratory failure in GBS (occurs in 30% of patients): Onset to admission &lt;7d, FVC &lt;60% predicted, presence of facial weakness, inability to cough/lift head/lift arms/stand.</p>
<h2 id="dysautonomia-70">Dysautonomia (70%)</h2>
<p>Manage and monitor for: paroxysmal hypertension (24%), orthostatic hypotension (19%), sinus tachycardia (25%), bradycardia, AV block, urinary retention, ileus.</p>
<h2 id="optimal-care">Optimal Care</h2>
<p>SLP, PT/IOT, DVTp, bowel and bladder care, repositioning.</p>
<h2 id="disease-modifying-therapy">Disease Modifying Therapy</h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">GBS Treatment</p>
<p>For nonambulatory patients within 4 weeks of symptoms, IVIg 2g/kg over 2-4 days total OR Plasma Exchange. There is likely no routine role for sequential treatments (i.e. PLEX then IVIg)</p>
</div>
<p><em>Plasma exchange</em> (PE) decreases the change of worsening when started if the patient is still ambulatory and decreases the time on MV and time to independent ambulation by 50%. The optimal number or dose is not yet established, but most patients receive 5 exchanges totalling 200-250 mL/kg every other day over 10 days. Albumin is preferred to FFP as a replacement fluid.</p>
<p><em>IVIg</em> is equally effective as PE. The standard dose is 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 days.</p>
<p>Combination therapy of PE + IVIg is not proven to be better than one alone and multiple trials have showed no improved outcomes with PE --&gt; IVIg compared to IVIg alone. For this reason, IVIG is usually the first line treatment due to safety and ease. </p>
<p><em>Steroids</em> are not helpful in AIDP, only in <a href="../Chronic%20Inflammatory%20Demyelinating%20Polyradiculoneuropathy%20%28CIDP%29/">CIDP</a>. In AIDP, it may increase the rate of relapse.</p>
